1) Use wildcards to create a single Unix command to:

    a) display the contents of only the 48 files "hw0.cpp" through "hw47.cpp";

    cat hw[0-9].cpp hw[1-3][0-9].cpp hw4[0-7].cpp

    b) list only files whose names are AT LEAST 7 characters long and have
       the 4 character suffix, ".cpp".

    ls *???.cpp

2) Provide an example for the Unix redirection operator which:

    a) sends the output of one command into the input of another;

    ls | sort

    b) appends the output of a command to an existing file;

    ls >> listing

    c) reads a file into a command without using the "cat" command.

    sort < listing

3) Set the permissions of the file "myprogram.exe" to have read, write,
   and execute permission for yourself, with only read and execute
   permission for others.

    chmod 755 myprogram.exe

4) Provide a Unix command to extract the lines with "//" comments from
   only files with the ".cpp" suffix.

    grep // *.cpp

5) Write four different C++ statements, each demonstrating a
    different way to add 1 to the integer variable, "foo".

    ++foo; foo++; foo += 1; foo = foo + 1;

6) Provide 8 digit binary values for the following C++ literals:

    a) 11    00001011

    b) 011   00001001

    c) 0x11  00010001

7) For the binary number 01010101:

    a) provide its one's complement;

    10101010

    b) provide its two's complement.

    10101011

 8) Provide a C++ expression which computes the resultant angle (in degrees),
    in the interval [0, 360) of the sum of two non-negative integer angles
    where each angle could be >= 360 degrees:

    int angle1, angle2, sumAngle;

    sumAngle = (angle1 + angle2) % 360

 9) The size of what part of a floating point number determines its:

    a) range?      exponent

    b) precision?  mantissa

10) Describe, in one sentence, what a compiler does:

     A compiler translates a source language into a machine language.

11) Declare and initialize the smallest types that can hold the following
    literal values on eeyore without underflow or overflow:
    (use your own variable names)

    a) 50000U       unsigned short int afoo = 50000U;

    b) 3000000000   long int bfoo = 3000000000;

    c) 2.0e-38      float cfoo = 2.0e-38;

    d) 4.0e+38      double dfoo = 4.0e+38;

12) What is the difference between the literals, 'a' and "a"?

    'a' is a character, whereas "a" is a string.

13) Provide a C++ statement which accurately computes the following
    batting average (ratio of hits to atbats):

    int hits, atbats;
    double batAve;
    
    batAve = (float) hits / atbats;

14) What is the value of each of v, w, x, y, and z, after the
    following statements are executed?

    int v = 0; int w = 1; int x = 2; int y = 3; int z =4;

    w = x % y + y / x - --v * z++;

    v == -1 , w == 7 , x == 2 , y == 3 , z == 5

15) Write a c++ expression for the following reciprocal quadratic:

    1/(a*((x+b/(2*a))(x+b/(2*a))-(b*b/(4*a*a)-c/a)))
