<h2> Introduction:</h2>
This lab experiments with sorting algorithms.
<h2> Lab Assignment:</h2>

<h4> Problem Motivation and Definition:</h4>

<P> Sorting is a fundamental operation performed on data.
Different sorting algorithms exhibit different characteristics based on
the data.  This lab will explore some of them.

<P> We will modify and run the programs for the three sorting algorithms
selection, bubble, and insertion, that we studied in Chapter 8.
We will modify the three programs to reverse sort order based on the status
of a flag parameter, work with multiple lines of data, and count the number
of comparisons and the number of data exchanges.


<h4> Solution Specification:</h4>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>
Create a new directory, <i>lab10</i>, and move to it.</li>

<li>
Copy ~cs201400/p4m.cpp, ~cs201400/p6m.cpp, and ~cs201400/p8m.cpp to
your lab10 directory.
</li>

<li>
Edit and complete each file to solve the above problem,
rename each source file and executable to reflect the type of sort it
performs.
</li>

<li>
For each sort program, perform the following modifications:
<ol>
    <li>
    Create a 50 element array of random integers in the range of [0,99] to
    sort.
    </li>
    <li>
    Modify the array printing to print 10 integers per row. [see Program
    8-3 in the text for an example]
    </li>
    <li>
    Modify the sort functions to accept a parameter [a flag] which
    indicates whether to sort the data from smallest to largest or from
    largest to smallest.  You will ask for and read this flag from standard
    input.
    </li>
    <li>
    Use two global variables to count the number of comparisons and the
    number of exchanges that were performed on the data.  Print the
    result with an identifying message at the end of the program.
    </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
Run each program twice: once for a forward sort of the data, and once for
a backwards sort of the data.
</li>

<li>
When correct, generate a printout of the source, and demonstrate, via
typescript, the source and the running of the programs.
Bring the printout to the next lecture for discussion.
</li>

</ol>
