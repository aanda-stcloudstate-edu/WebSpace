<H3>What to Hand In</H3>
For each programming assignment, turn in the following five parts. The links
here connect to the parts of a small <B>example assignment</B>.
Its program carries out a simple text-formatting task.
The program also illustrates opening files for input and output and
reading from and writing to them. The five parts of an assignment are:
<OL>
  <LI>A <A HREF="http://condor.stcloudstate.edu/~julstrom/cs301/proj-examp/design.html">design document</A>
    that describes the design of the program: what it does and how it does it.
    This document should be typed or word-processed. It should provide a
    description of the problem and enough detail about the program you have
    written to solve it that a reader, seeing nothing more than the
    design document, could substantially reproduce your program.
    Be sure not to plagiarize the assignment handouts.
    <P>
  <LI>Listings of the <A HREF="http://condor.stcloudstate.edu/~julstrom/cs301/proj-examp/format.cxx">code</A>
    for all the program's files.
    The code should be formatted for good readability and should include
    the usual comments, including an introductory comment that summarizes the
    program's purpose and design and includes the author's name, the course
    and section numbers, and the date the assignment is due.
    Each function's comments must include pre- and post-conditions:
    what must be true of the values going in, and what
    the calling code can expect to be true of the values coming back,
    assuming that the precondition is satisfied.
    <P>
  <LI>A <A HREF="http://condor.stcloudstate.edu/~julstrom/cs301/proj-examp/user.html">user document</A>
    that describes how to use the program. This
    document should be typed or word-processed.
    Include an example of how to run the program, and
    be sure to describe any requirements that input data must satisfy.
    Should the grader run your program, he or she will consult this
    document for directions; if they are not correct, neither is the document.
    Note that a user should <I>not</I> be told anything about
    how the program is implemented.
    <P>
  <LI>At least three <A HREF="http://condor.stcloudstate.edu/~julstrom/cs301/proj-examp/tests.txt">tests</A>
    showing that the program does what
    it is supposed to do. You will design your own test data.
    On the printout, annotate each data file and test to
    describe what feature(s) of the program the run is testing.
    Be sure to exercise each line and feature of the program.
    <P>
  <LI>A <A HREF="http://condor.stcloudstate.edu/~julstrom/cs301/proj-examp/summary.html">summary</A>
    of what you learned from the assignment, how
    your solution to the problem might be extended or improved, and answers
    to any questions posed on the assignment page. This, too, should be typed
    or word-processed.
</OL>
<P>
Three of these five parts are <I>about</I> the program, but are not
the program itself or tests of it. This is intentional, and the
grading of programming assignments will reflect it. Designing and
documenting programs are essential skills in computing, and
we will pay attention to developing those skills.
<P>
More generally, it is essential to be able to communicate effectively
in writing. Here, that communication is about problems and the programs that
implement solutions to them.
There are many resources that you can use to improve your writing.
Among them, the <A HREF="http://leo.stcloudstate.edu">Write Place</A>
on campus here offers both on-line and in-person help.

<H3>Grading</H3>
Programming assignments will be evaluated using a 50-point scale, with the
points allocated to the five parts of a assignment in this way:
