<h3>Recursion Exercises</h3>
<P>
Write programs that demonstrate the following <u>recursive</u> and <u>iterative</u> <b>functions</b>.
<P>
For the following recursion exercises:
<ul>
    <li>Create an output (text) file to submit by using the Unix <tt>script</tt> command to iteratively display each problem solution in the following order:
    <ol>
	<li> the function source code [include the problem number as a header comment in each function. (e.g. "Problem 2.3" for the third problem of this homework)]
	<li> white space
	<li> a few runs of the function's test driver using good, representative, test data <br> (i.e. the output should not be a palindrome, or all the same characters, if ordering is a concern)
	<li> white space
    </ol>
</ul>
<P>
We want these recursive functions to be lightweight and as terse as possible (but readable), so for each recursive function,
<ol>
    <li>have a header comment line stating your name, course, semester &amp; year
    <li>have a header comment line stating the problem number
    <li>have a header comment line stating what the recursive function does
    <li>have a header comment line for each parameter stating its preconditions
    <li>have an in-line comment identifying the base case. (even if the base case is to <i>do nothing</i>)
    <li>use <tt>assert()</tt> to enforce the preconditions.
    <li>use descriptive identifiers
</ol>
<P>
Here are your problems:
<ol>
    <li> Exercise 2.3
    <li> Exercise 2.7 (there should be a space following each integer value)
    <li> Exercise 2.8
    <li> Exercise 2.4
    <li> Exercise 2.9
    <li> Write a void recursive function which accepts the two parameters, a non-negative integer value (base 10) and a destination base,
	and writes the value of the input integer in the destination base (2 &le; base &le; 10) <br>
	(e.g.) "<tt>base10convert 30 3</tt>" writes "<tt>1010</tt>"
    <li> Develop the following functions which will perform integer powers of a <tt>double</tt><br>
    Count &amp; print the number of multiplications &amp; (<i>for the recursive functions</i>) stack depth in each case.<br>
    Test on 1.01^1000
    <ol>
	<li>iterative linear
	<li>recursive linear
	<li><a href="http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=BinaryExponentiation">iterative binary</a>
	<li>recursive binary <i>{be sure not to call twice}</i> See Ex 2.18
    </ol>
    <li> Implement the recursive <tt>rabbit()</tt> function where the function uses a static array to record computed values.<br>
	Each computed value will be added to the set of base cases.  Compare the number of recursive calls in this implementation vs. the text's (p. 80).
    <li> Programming Problem (p. 93) 2.2
    <li> Programming Problem (p. 93) 2.4
    <li>Develop <i>Ackerman's function</i> (Ex.2.25) and test  with <tt>Acker</tt>(<i>m,n</i>) for {0 &le; <i>m</i> &le; 3} &amp; {0 &le; <i>n</i> &le; 4}<br>
    Count &amp; print the number of calls &amp; maximum stack depth in each case.<br>
</ol>
<P>
<b><i>Testing hint</i>:</b> create a single test data file containing an unsorted array of integers which you can use for Exercise 3 and Programming Problems 2 and 4. (<tt>cat</tt> this file in your script)
<P>

<b>Note:</b> because these are exercises, only internal comments and output comments will be expected as documentation for this assignment.
