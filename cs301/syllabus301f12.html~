REQUIRED TEXTS:  * Data Abstraction and Problem Solving with C++:
		    Walls and Mirrors - 5th ed.,
                  Frank M. Carrano, Addison Wesley, 2007.

                 * Introduction to the Personal Software Process,
                   W. S. Humphrey, Addison Wesley, 1997.

COURSE DESCRIPTION:
    Recursion and recurrence. Trees, binary trees, 2/3 trees, directed
    and undirected graphs, searching and sorting, program layering.
    Sequential file processing, indexed files, and hashing techniques.

TOPICS (not necessarily in order of coverage):
    * Review of Stacks, Queues and Exception Handlers
    * Software engineering principles: design, testing, documentation etc.
    * Recursion and Recurrence relations
    * Binary trees and their implementations 
    * General trees: their implementation and applications.
	This includes the binary and ternary tree representation of general
	trees, traversals and efficiency considerations, and more work with
	recursion.
    * 2/3 trees and balancing
    * Graphs and networks, their implementation, traversal, path algorithms,
	spanning trees, and topological orderings.
    * Conceptual graphs and their implementation using brute force techniques,
	best-first techniques, and the MinMax algorithm.
    * Sequential files
    * Indexed files
    * Hashing techniques
    * and more...
    * (I will expect students to learn the complexities {big-O()} of the
        operations on the data structures we discuss and to be able
        to select, based on those complexities, the most appropriate ADT
        considering the nature of the data and how it will be accessed.)

PREREQUISITES:
    [Prereq.: CSCI 201. Coreq.: MATH 273]

    * Parameter passage. 
    * I/O streams. Reading from and writing to files. 
    * Arrays and simple sorting algorithms. 
    * Time complexity and the big-O notation. 
    * Structs and arrays of records. 
    * Pointers and dynamic arrays. 
    * Recursion.

    * Linear data structures 
	* The list abstract data type. 
	* Linked lists.  
	* Stacks. 
	* Queues. 
    * Exceptions and exception handling.

CLASS ACCOUNTS:
    You will be given an account for use in this class.  All work for this
    class must be done in this account and the account must not be used for
    any other class.  You may not let anyone else use the account unless that
    person is a student in this class and is working on a class project
    with you.

PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENTS HOMEWORK AND IN CLASS WORK:
    There will be 4 to 6 programming assignments.  Assignments must be submitted
     by the beginning of class on the day they are due.  No allowances will be
    made for down time on the computer, so I suggest you begin each assignment
    as soon as you receive it.  Programs not turned in on the due-date will be
    penalized, if accepted.  A program is late if it is turned in after the
    beginning of class on the due date.

    A program should compile to receive significant credit.  All programs
    should produce correct output given error free input.  Check your
    output before getting the final copy to turn in.  Don't assume that a
    program that produces some output without terminating abnormally is
    correct.  Test your program carefully and extensively.  You have not
    tested your program if you have not executed <u>every</u> line of code.
    <i>Preconditions</i> and <i>postconditions</i> must be consistent and
    well-defined.  The code should satisfy the postconditions if the
    preconditions are met.
    Conversely, if a precondition is violated, that exception should be
    detected and handled.

    The grade you get on a program is based on the code, the documentation and
    how well it is tested.  To receive better than a C on a program it must do
    more than produce correct output given correct input.  By this I mean your
    program must be robust, well documented, well tested and well written.

    Missing class on days that we have in-class assignments will result in a
    zero for that assignment.  These assignments cannot be made up.  If you
    have trouble getting to class, drop now so that someone else can use the
    spot.

    All homework, documentation and programs must be neat.

ACADEMIC HONESTY:
    You are expected to do your own homework.  If you copy someone else's
    work or allow someone else to copy your work, you are being academically
    dishonest and will be subject to severe disciplinary action which may
    include any or all of: no credit for the work in question, a failing grade
    for the course, notification to the university that you have violated your
    Code of Conduct.  Use of recording devices during exams is prohibited.
    If you must quote or paraphrase another source, citation is essential,
    otherwise plagiarism has been committed.  You are expected to be familiar
    with your rights and obligations as outlined in the &quot;Code of Conduct&quot;

STUDYING IN GROUPS:
    I encourage you to study with someone else in the class, but when you
    prepare the final documents to turn in be sure that it is your own words
    and sentences and that you understand it.  If you represent someone
    else’s work as your own or allow someone else to turn your work in as
    theirs you will be turned in for cheating and will be given an F.

DECORUM: Conduct yourself so as not to distract others. In particular
    * Turn off all cell phones, watch alarms, and similar devices.
    * Do not engage in distracting activities like reading a newspaper
      or sleeping. (some of you snore...)
    * Arrive for class on time, and be ready to begin.
      If you must be late, be quiet.
    * If you are early, sit toward the middle of a row.
    * Do not start packing up before class ends.

ATTENDANCE:
    You are responsible for knowing what happens at each class meeting.
    You should expect to spend a lot of time on this class.  It is not an
    easy class.  If you are having trouble in class I expect to see you in
    my office.  If you don't tell me you are having troubles how do you
    expect me to know?  If you can't come during my office hours, make an
    appointment for another time.

QUIZZES:
    There will be a sequence of quizzes of assigned readings.
EXAMS:
    There will be a small set of intermediate exams and a <u>comprehensive</u>
    final exam.
    Exams will be based on the notes; that is, on the presentations in class
    as well as on the assigned readings and assignments.
    Calculators will be neither necessary nor allowed except by prior arrangement.
    Make-up exams will be given in only in extreme (or university
    sanctioned) circumstances and only with prior notice.

GRADING:
        Your grade will be determined by the contributions of your scores
        on assignments,  quizzes, intermediate and final exams.
        Makeup of tests, quizzes, and exams are by prior arrangement only.

APPROXIMATE POINTS:
        Assignments             35%
        Quizzes                 05%
        Hour Exams              30%
        Final Exam              30%

FINAL EXAM: Tuesday, December 18, 10:15 - 12:45 in EB B208.

CAVEAT:
    I reserve the right to amend the contents of this syllabus with
    notification.
