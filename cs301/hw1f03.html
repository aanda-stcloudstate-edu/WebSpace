  <DT>TITLE
    <DD><B>DETECTING PALINDROMES</B>
    <P>
  <DT>INTRODUCTION
    <DD>A <B>palindrome</B> is a string that reads the same forwards
    and backwards (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).
    Examples are the familiar ``If I had a hi-fi,'' and the grander
    ``A man, a plan, a canal, Panama.''
    <P>
  <DT>DESCRIPTION
    <DD>You are to design, implement, document, and test a program that
    reads a line of input from the terminal and reports whether or not
    that line is a palindrome. The object of this assignment is to review
    and exercise C++ in general and arrays and strings in C++ in
    particular.
    <P>
  <DT>INPUT
    <DD>An input line may contain any characters, though <I>only letters</I>
    are relevant in palindromes. The maximum length of the input is 80
    characters (one line on the terminal).
    <P>
  <DT>OUTPUT
    <DD>The program will prompt for the input line---a candidate
    palindrome---and will report whether or not the line is a palindrome.
    <P>
  <DT>ERRORS
    <DD>The program may assume that the input is as described.
    It need not detect any errors.
    <P>
  <DT>EXAMPLE
    <DD>Several runs of the program might look like this:
    <PRE>
      csh> pal
      Enter a line that might be a palindrome:
      Madam I'm Adam.
      The string is a palindrome.

      csh> pal
      Enter a line that might be a palindrome:
      Able was I ere I saw Elba.
      The string is a palindrome.

      csh> pal
      Enter a line that might be a palindrome:
      Go hang a salami, I'm a lasagna hog.
      The string is a palindrome.

      csh> pal
      Enter a line that might be a palindrome:
      This is another candidate string.
      The string is NOT a palindrome.
    </PRE>
    <P>
  <DT>OTHER REQUIREMENTS
    <DD>Use arrays of <TT><B>char</B></TT>acters to hold any strings that the
    program manipulates, and terminate strings within those arrays
    with the null character '\0'. Write at least one function, and
    use functions from the library <TT><B>strings.h</B></TT> as necessary.
    <P>
  <DT>HINTS
    <DD>Consider reading the input one character at a time and
    preserving only the letters; they're all that's interesting, after all.
    Note the <TT><B>iostream.h</B></TT> function <TT><B>get(ch)</B></TT>,
    which reads exactly one character, including the blank. The
    following loop will read all the characters in an input line, one at a
    time, into the variable <TT><B>c</B></TT>.
    <PRE>
      char c;
        .
         .
          .
      cin.get(c);
      while ( c >= ' ' )
      {
        < Do something with c. >

        cin.get(c);
      }
    </PRE>
    Appendix F in the text describes input and output in C++ in more detail.
