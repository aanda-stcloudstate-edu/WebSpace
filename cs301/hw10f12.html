<h3>Huffman coding and decoding</h3>
Create the following functions to support a Huffman code based file compression and decompression:
<ul>
    <li>Create an <code>vector</code> or <code>map</code> with the <b>frequencies</b> of each ASCII character in an (uncompressed) input file.
    <ul>
	<li>Also create a <code>bitset<256></code> object for which each bit is <code>false</code> if the corresponding ASCII character frequency is zero, and <code>true</code> otherwise.
    </ul>
    <li>Build a Huffman tree from the non-zero ASCII character frequencies.
    <li>Print the following set of information regarding the Huffman tree:
    <ul>
	<li>Two human readable tables of binary Huffman character codes. One in <u>ASCII</u> order and the other in <u>frequency</u> order.  Skip characters with zero frequency.
	<ul>
	    <li>Format five columns: character, frequency, probability (3 digits precision, scientific format), number of bits, and binary code.
	</ul>
	<li>The number of bits in the (uncompressed) input file
	<li>The number of bits in the (compressed) output file. (the sum of each character frequency * the number of that character's encoded bits)
	<li>The compression ratio (the number of uncompressed bits / the number of compressed bits) 
	<li>The average length (in bits) of a compressed character. ( 8 / compression ratio)
    </ul>
    <h5>Extra Credit:</h5>
    <li>Create a Huffman class, and make these functions methods in this class.
    <li>Write the Huffman compressed bit string to an output file.
    <ul>
	<li>First, write a header consisting of the Boolean bitstring flagging the non-zero characters, then the frequencies of those nonzero characters.
	<li>Then write the compressed text.
    </ul>
    <li>Uncompress a compressed file written by your Huffman class.
    <ul>
	<li>First, generate the Huffman tree from header.
	<li>Then, use the Huffman tree to uncompress the rest of the file.
    </ul>
    <h5>Permitted Variations:</h5>
    <ul>
	<li>Rather than save the frequencies in the file header, you may instead prefer to save the Huffman tree itself.
	<li>You may also transform your Huffman tree to be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_Huffman_code">cannonical</a> Huffman tree and use that instead. 
    </ul>
</ul>
<P>
You may use any combination of your own classes, our textbook's source code classes, and the STL.<br>
<b>If you use or modify code from other sources, you <u>must</u> cite the source and indicate which code segment of yours is based on external sources.</b>
<P>
Test your code with long files of the following types:
<ul>
    <li>HTML Web page that's mostly links (e.g. our CSCI 301 Webpage);
    <li>C++ source code (e.g. the tarball of the source code for an open source application);
    <li>book in ASCII (e.g. from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>);
    <li>a BibTeX file (e.g. <code>http://www.netlib.org/bib/gvl.bib</code>)
    <li>a LaTeX file (e.g. <code>http://nealeyoung-huffman.googlecode.com/svn-history/r86/trunk/neal_sicomp_2010/journal.tex</code>)
    <li>an XML file (e.g. <code>http://www.wunderground.com/autobrand/Heathrow_Sample.xml</code>)
</ul>
You should see significantly different character frequency and compression characteristics in these files.<br>
If you do the extra credit I/O component, ensure that the original text matches the compressed/uncompressed text (use diff) and that your statistic match the file sizes.<br>
Compare the performance of your Huffman code based compression tool with those compression utilties on <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">csci</span>2, e.g. <code>compress</code>, <code>gzip</code>, <code>bzip2</code>, and <code>pack</code>.

<HR>
For the above problem, please follow these guidelines:
<ol type=I>
    <h5>General Documentation </h5>
    <li>your <b>name</b>, <b>course</b>, <b>date</b>, and
	<b>assignment number</b> will appear as <u>comments</u> at the top
	of your source code.<br>
	(<i>Do this before you write any code</i>)</li>
    <li>the <b>purpose</b> of the program will also appear as <u>comments</u>
    at the top of your source code.<br>
    (<i>Do this before you write any code</i>)</li>
    <h5>Module Documentation</h5>
    <li>the purpose of important statements or blocks of statements in the
	source code of your program will be described by <u>comments</u>
	preceding them.<br>
	(<i>Do this before you write any code</i>)</li>
	<li> Fully document <b>preconditions</b>, <b>invariants</b> and <b>postconditions</b> 
    <h5>Data Names </h5>
    <li>use <i>intelligent</i> <u>data names</u> which match the terminology
    of the user as closely as possible.</li>
    <P>
    <li>use <u>whitespace</u> and <i>consistent</i> C-style <u>indenting</u> to enhance the
    readability of your code.  In vim:</li>
    <ul>
	<li><tt>:set sw=4</tt>
	<li><tt>:set cindent</tt>
    </ul>
    <P>
    <li>compile your code with <br><tt>g++  -Wall </tt> <i>filename</i><tt>.cpp -o</tt> <i>filename</i><br>(ensure that there are no compiler warnings or errors)
    <P>
    <li>use <b>script</b> on <i>csci</i> to generate a file which contains
    a (<tt>script</tt> file) demonstration of the (possibly interactive)
    running of your program (on good test data).
    There should be several runs.<cr>
    <li>follow the guidelines in <a href="http://web.stcloudstate.edu/bajulstrom/cs301/handin.html">What to hand in</a>.
    <li>use <u>doxygen</u> to help generate your documentation.
</ol>
<P>
Be neat.
