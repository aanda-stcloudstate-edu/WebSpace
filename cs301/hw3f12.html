<h3>ADT Specification and Implementation Exercises</h3>
<P>
    Specify, implement, and test <b>ADT</b>s which contribute to solutions of selected programming problems.
<P>
For the following ADTs:
<ul>
    <li>Plan and impliment a test driver file for your ADT.  Ensure that some of your tests exercise exceptional input conditions (e.g. boundaries, special cases, and precondition violations).
    <li>Your header files should include (<i>as comments</i>) all information that the user should require to use your ADT. [use applicable Doxygen tags.  E.g. @pre and @post]<br>
	Include your specification of how input precondition violations will be handled.
    <li>Create an output (text) file to submit by using the Unix <tt>script</tt> command to iteratively display each problem solution in the following order:
    <ol>
	<li> the ADT's header file and implementation file [include the problem ID as a header comment in each function. (e.g. "Carrano Problem 3.2" [chapter#.problem#] )]
	<li> white space
	<li> The test driver output
	<li> horizontal line
	<li> white space
    </ol>
</ul>
<P>
We want these ADTs to be lightweight (but readable), so for each ADT,
<ol>
    <li>include all necessary methods, constructors, and destructors
    <li>include a header comment lines each stating, respectively: 
    <ol>
	<li>the file name (remember to change this if you change the name of the file)
	<li>the relative path to the directory that this file contained in (e.g. <tt>"~cs301###/Assignments/A_3/Problem_3.2/"</tt>)
	<li>the problem ID
	<li>your name, course, semester &amp; year
    </ol>
    <li>have header comments stating what the ADT does
    <li>have a header comment line for each parameter stating its preconditions
    <li>use descriptive identifiers
</ol>
<P>
Here are your problems:
<ol>
    <li> Programming Problem 3.2 (&amp; 3.12);
    <ul>
	<li> Note that the number of <u>minutes</u> to update <i>must</i> be non-negative and could be quite large.
	<li> Include a set of methods for the <tt>private</tt> Boolean flag determining whether a 12 or 24 hour notation is to be displayed.
    </ul>
    <li> Programming Problem 3.3;
    <ul>
	<li> <u>Ignore</u> the last sentence regarding computing the name of the day.  (<i>it's a nice exercise, but it doesn't advance the learning objectives for this assignment</i>)
	<li> Remember to handle correctly <u>leap years</u> for <i>all</i> years (0 &le; <tt>years</tt>).
	<li> Include a set of methods for the <tt>private</tt> Boolean flag determining whether numbers, or words, for the month are to be displayed.
    </ul>
    <li> Programming Problem 3.4;
    <ul>
	<li> Remember to handle correctly <u>insufficient payments</u>. Payments are to be non-negative counts of dollars and/or cents.
	<li> Compute change {quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies} using the <i>fewest</i> number of coins.
    </ul>
    <li> Programming Problem 3.11a;
    <ul>
	<li> Remember to handle correctly the case of denominators being zero.
    </ul>
</ol>

<P>
<b>Note:</b> because these are lightweight exercises, only internal comments and output comments will be expected as documentation for this assignment.
