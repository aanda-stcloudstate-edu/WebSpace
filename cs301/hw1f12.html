<h3>Dealing Sorted Playing Card Hands</h3>
<P>
Write a program to generate and print a set of sorted playing card hands from
a single deck.
<P>

Specifications:
<ol>
    <li>The program will read, <i>in any order</i>, the following program flags and options from the command line:
    <ul>
	<li>number of hands (ordered sets of cards) [default == 4]
	<li>number of cards per hand [default == 5]
	<li>sort first on value or suit? [default == value]
	<li>is Ace high or low in sort? [default == high]
	<li>suit ranking order from high to low [default == "shcd"]
	<li>maximum number of cards/hand to discard and redraw from deck [default == 0]
	<li><tt>srand()</tt> argument [default == <tt>srand()</tt> uses <tt>time()</tt> as an argument]
	<li><tt>-d</tt> "d" stands for <u>dump</u> or <u>debug</u>. You will output intermediate values to help in debugging.
	<ul>
	    <li> feel free to add a facility for this option to accept an integer argument to control the amount and degree of debugging information
	</ul>
	<li> <i>Add any other options you'd like.</i>
	<li><i>Either of the following two options will prevent the normal execution of the program.  All other options will be ignored</i>
	<li><tt>-V</tt> output the version ID.  (<i>this will help you identify which executable you're using</i>)
	<li> Calling the program with NO arguments will be treated as a cry for help.  In this case, output usage instructions.
    </ul>

    <li>The program will output to the <u>standard output</u> stream for each hand:
    <ol>
	<li>An ordinal identifier for that hand
	<li>The cards in the hand ordered from low to high on its own line.<br>
	For each card, the value will precede the suit. (<i>See Programming Problem 1.4 for an example</i>)
    </ol>
    <li>After all of the hands have been displayed:
    <ol>
	<li>The program will output the number of cards remaining in the deck.
	<li>If cards can be discarded and redrawn, the program will prompt the user for the number of cards they wish to discard/redraw. <br>
	The program will redisplay the hand with each card's ordinal position displayed underneath it.<br>
	The program will prompt the user for each position to discard/redraw.
	<li>After all of the hands have been updated, they will be redisplayed, each hand in sorted order.
	<li>The program will output the the revised number of cards remaining in the deck.
    </ol>

    <li>The method to select the cards for a hand should use an <u>array of pointers</u> to a <tt>static</tt> array of 52 ordinal values.<br>
    Once a card has been selected, it must not appear in another hand or the same hand, before or after discard/redraw.
    <li>The method to sort the cards in a hand should use that same array of pointers to a static array of 52 ordinal values.
    <li> <b>Note:</b> In both the selection and sorting methods, <i>only the pointers</i> should be rearranged.

    <li>Ensure that your program detects bad, undefined, and out-of-range input errors both on the command line and during execution.  Error messages should go to <u>standard error</u>.
    <ul>
	<li>A bad command line argument should prevent the normal execution of the program.  Output usage instructions (as in the case with no arguments).
	<li>Ensure that your test data exercises these error handlers.
    </ul>
    <li>Focus on the modularity of your design.  Try to maximize <i>cohesion</i> and minimize <i>coupling</i>.
    
    <li> Before the program exits, be sure to release back to the <i>heap</i> all dynamic memory objects.</li>
</ol>

<HR>
For the above problem, please follow these guidelines:
<ol type=I>
    <h5>General Documentation </h5>
    <li>your <b>name</b>, <b>course</b>, <b>date</b>, and
	<b>assignment number</b> will appear as <u>comments</u> at the top
	of your source code.<br>
	(<i>Do this before you write any code</i>)</li>
    <li>the <b>purpose</b> of the program will also appear as <u>comments</u>
    at the top of your source code.<br>
    (<i>Do this before you write any code</i>)</li>
    <h5>Module Documentation</h5>
    <li>the purpose of important statements or blocks of statements in the
	source code of your program will be described by <u>comments</u>
	preceding them.<br>
	(<i>Do this before you write any code</i>)</li>
	<li> Fully document <b>preconditions</b>, <b>invariants</b> and <b>postconditions</b> 
    <h5>Data Names </h5>
    <li>use <i>intelligent</i> <u>data names</u> which match the terminology
    of the user as closely as possible.</li>
    <P>
    <li>use <u>whitespace</u> and <i>consistent</i> C-style <u>indenting</u> to enhance the
    readability of your code.  In vim:</li>
    <ul>
	<li><tt>:set sw=4</tt>
	<li><tt>:set cindent</tt>
    </ul>
    <P>
    <li>compile your code with <br><tt>g++  -Wall </tt> <i>filename</i><tt>.cpp -o</tt> <i>filename</i><br>(ensure that there are no compiler warnings or errors)
    <P>
    <li>use <b>script</b> on <i>csci</i> to generate a file which contains
    a (<tt>script</tt> file) demonstration of the (possibly interactive)
    running of your program (on good test data).
    There should be several runs.<cr>
    <li>follow the guidelines in <a href="http://web.stcloudstate.edu/bajulstrom/cs301/handin.html">What to hand in</a>.
    <li>use <u>doxygen</u> to help generate your documentation.
</ol>
<P>
Be neat.
