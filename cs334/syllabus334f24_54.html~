REQUIRED TEXTS: * Writing For Computer Science  3rd Ed. [paperback], Justin Zobel, Springer, 2015; ISBN-13: 978-1-4471-6638-2.
COURSE DESCRIPTION:
    Oral and written communication in the context of the computing sciences.
    Intended to be taken in the <i>penultimate</i> semester of the program.

SLOs:
    * Acquire those oral and written communication skills required for effective performance as computer scientists.

PREREQUISITES:
CSCI331 - Software Systems

INTENT:
    The intent of this class is to evaluate a compilation/portfolio of your writing demonstrating the breadth 
    and quality of the several contexts of computer science writing expected of a Computer Science major program undergraduate student.

    Each assignment exhibits a different modality of computer science writing, a research paper and its presentation, 
    and the following writing artifacts expected as deliverable components of a software development project:
    * literate programming (usually via Doxygen), 
    * source code documentation,
    * user manual documentation,
    * design documentation
    * testing documentation

ASSIGNMENTS:
    Assignments are due in their D2L dropbox by their due-date and time.
    Late work may be accepted as long as the D2L assignment drop box remains open.
    
    All assignments can represent prior work you have written for other CSCI courses,
    as long as that work is exclusively your own work -- documents you <i>collaborated</i> on are <b><i>not</i></b> acceptable.

    If you haven't produced (<i>by yoursef</i>) an example of an assignment in another class, you are expected to generate an example for this class.
    The five software development documents <b><i>do not</i></b> have to be from the same project -- they can <i>all</i> be from different projects.

    However, the research paper presentation (slides) <b><i>must</i></b> describe the research paper you submit.

    Your writing must not be AI generated.

ACADEMIC HONESTY:
    You are expected to do your own work.  If you copy someone else's work
    or allow someone else to copy your work, you are being academically
    dishonest and will be subject to severe disciplinary action which may
    include any or all of: no credit for the work in question, a failing grade
    for the course, notification to the university that you have violated your
    Code of Conduct.

ATTENDANCE &amp; CONDUCT:
    You are responsible for knowing what happens at each class meeting.
    Do not engage in disruptive or distracting activities. (this includes
    allowing your cell phone to ring audibly during class)

EXAMS:
    Make-up exams will be given in only in extreme (or university sanctioned)
    circumstances, and only with prior notice.

GRADING:
    Your grade will be determined by the contributions of your scores
    on Assignments.

APPROXIMATE POINTS:
        Assignments 100%

NO FINAL EXAM
