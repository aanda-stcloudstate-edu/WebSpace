Research paper checklist:

* If conducting a numerical experiment use a table to describe your system parameters 
	(e.g. clock, cores, memory, caches, OS version, language, compiler version)

* Use Courier New (or other non-proportional font) for computer I/O, code, URLs, etc.)

* Number & syntax-highlight code

* Use a math environment for all math (only variables are italicized). Number only equations you refer to.

* Use capitolization only for acronyms and proper nouns -- use italics for emphasis

* All floats must be referred to explicitly by name and number (e.g. in Figure 4, ...). No reference --> no float.

* Floats must each fit on only one page.

* All bibliographic entries must be referenced in your text.  No reference --> no entry in bib.

* Hyperlink URLs in your bibliography. (use your favorite narrow non-proportional font)

* No references in the abstract.

* Use active present tense, except for conclusion.  (e.g. in abstract: "We show ..."; in conclusion: "We showed ...")

* Double spaced, ragged right margin, 10--12 pt. font preferred.

* Page numbers!!!

* After a heading, text should be written as if the heading didn't appear.

* Tables: use consistent and modest number of significant digits -- use scientific notation for better scaling.

* Charts: no information should be represented by color only.

* Eliminate potential ambiguous or faulty reference (.e.g. "its")

Slide presentation checklist:

* Each slide self-contained, i.e. no references off the slide -- explicit URLs

* Readable from a relatively long distance.  Terse bullet points in lists.

* Avoid using complete sentences and paragraphs which could tempt you to read them verbatim.

* Prioritize visuals.

* Content should be a significant subset of the research paper content.
