Mathematical Developments

Mathematical Development Stages
leading to the development of the modern computer:

1. Zero and the development of place-value notation and 
  arithmetic

2. Development of algebraic thought: abstraction and 
  generalization

3. Development of logical thought: diagrams, graphs, 
  and rules & methodology of formal logic

4. From classical logic to algebraic and binary logic: 
  algebra of propositional logic

5. Development of artificial logical calculation: 
  Shannon's thesis on the theory of switching

6. From algebra to set theory: Cantor to G ^{..}o del.

7. From philosophical logic to mathematical logic

8. Development of symbolic calculus: recursive function 
  theory, automata and formal languages
