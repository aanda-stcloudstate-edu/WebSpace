For each of the following problems you will solve:
<ol type=I>
    <li>your <b>name</b>, <b>course</b>, <b>date</b>, and <b>assignment number</b> will appear as comments at the top of your source code.
    <P>
    <li>the <b>purpose</b> of the program will also appear as comments at the top of your source code.
    <P>
    <li>use <b>comments</b> <i>throughout</i> your code to describe what your code is doing.
    <P>
    <li>follow closely the coding style of the text.
    <P>
    <li>compile your code with <tt>g++  -Wall </tt> <i>filename</i><tt>.cpp -o</tt> <i>filename</i> (ensure that there are no compiler warnings or errors)
    <P>
    <li> You will submit the source code and a script file demonstrating the
    interactive running of your program on <u>good test data</u>
    (<i>as defined below</i>).

<P>
Write a program to perform Project 51 in Chapter 8 (page 411), with the
following addenda:
<ul>
    <li>Assume that the scores are integers between 0 and 100 inclusive.
    <li>Also, compute and print the geometric and harmonic means of the scores.
    <br>[See Project 6.53 on Page 294]
    <br>(<b>Note:</b> zero scores can't be used in the harmonic mean)
    <li>Also, use the arithmetic mean to compute the standard deviation too.<br>
    (Use <i>Formula 5</i> from
   <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/StandardDeviation.html">here</a>)
   <li> Print:
   <ul>
       <li>the number of entries,
       <li>the arithmetic mean,
       <li>the geometric mean,
       <li>the harmonic mean,
       <li>the median,
       <li>the mode,
       <li>and the standard deviation,
   </ul>
	all with descriptive labeling.
	<li> You may use Standard I/O.
	<li> Exception handling:
	<ul>
	    <li> Omit the harmonic mean with a <i>warning</i> to the user
	    if there's a <u>zero</u> entry.
	    <li> Warn the user if there are <u>no</u> entries
	    <li> Warn the user if there are <u>more than 50</u> entries in the file
	    <br> and that <u>only the first 50</u> will be used
	</ul>
	<li> Show that your program will work properly for:
	<ul>
	    <li> an empty data file
	    <li> a data file with one entry (st. dev. = 0)
	    <li> a data file with two entries
	    <li> a data file with three entries
	    <li> a data file with 49 entries
	    <li> a data file with 50 entries
	    <li> a data file with 51 entries
	</ul>
	<li> You can check your results using a spreadsheet
	<li> <b>Extra Credit:</b> Use a two dimensional array to assist in
	printing the histogram right-side-up (rather than rotated as the text does).
    </ul>
