  <B>Homework Assignment 1: DESIGNING and DESCRIBING ALGORITHMS</b><BR>

<i>Definition:</i> <B>algorithm</B>: A sequence of well-defined
instructions for carrying out an operation or solving a problem.
<P>
<i>Definition:</i> <B>loop</B>: A sequence of instructions that are repeated
until some condition is met, or indefinitely.
<P>
For each of the following problems you will solve:
<ol type=I>
<li>describe your algorithm using <i>pseudocode</i> (use <b>Program 1-4 </b>of
<i>Forouzan</i> as a template)
<li>describe your algorithm using a <i>flowchart</i> (see <b>Figure 1-13</b>
and <b>Appendix C</b>)
<li>Demonstrate that your algorithm works properly by describing what happens
at each step, from start to finish, for a good (non-trivial) test case.
</ol>
<P>
Do <B>not</B> write code in any programming language,
<P>
Be neat.
<P>
<i>Caution:</i> each <i>variable</i> (e.g. <tt>bath_length</tt>) that you use in an <i>expression</i> (e.g.  <tt>bath_length</tt> *  <tt>bath_width</tt>), a
<i>comparison</i> (e.g. <tt><b>if</b> (time == 60) <b>then</b></tt>), a
<i>return</i> value, or a <i>write</i> value, must have been <i>initialized</i>
with some actual value either by an <i>assignment</i> (e.g. <tt>time = 0</tt>)
or by a <i>read</i> (e.g. <tt><b>read</b> bath_length</tt>).
<P>

<OL>
  <LI>Describe an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer <I>N</I>
    and returns the sum of the first <I>N</I> squares:
    <DIV ALIGN=center>
      1<SUP>2</SUP> + 2<SUP>2</SUP> + 3<SUP>2</SUP> + ... +
             <I>N</I><SUP>2</SUP>
    </DIV>
    <P>
    Note that this algorithm will contain a loop.
    <P>
  <LI>On many bank accounts, interest is compounded daily.
    For example, if the nominal yearly interest rate is 6% = 0.06, the 
    daily rate is (0.06/365).
    Thus, an initial balance of $1,000.00 earns $1,000.00 * (0.06/365) =
    $0.16 at the end of its first day on deposit; the new balance is $1000.16.
    <P>
    On the second day, the interest will be (0.06/365) times $1000.16,
    which will be added to the account, and so on.
    <P>
    Describe an algorithm which takes as input the following three values,
    <ul>
	<li>an initial balance,
	<li>an interest rate, and
	<li>the number of compounding days,
    </ul>
    and produces as output the final balance after the specified duration.
    This algorithm, too, will require a loop.
    <P>
    <li> Describe an algorithm which, given any amount, from $0.00 to $1.00,
    will be able to make change from a dollar using the <i>fewest</i>
    number of coins. (e.g. given $0.08, it will print out the value of $0.92
    as: <tt>3 quarter(s), 1 dime(s), 1 nickel(s), and 2 cent(s)</tt>.)
