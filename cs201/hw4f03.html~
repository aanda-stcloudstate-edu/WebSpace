For the following problem which you will solve:
<ol type=I>
    <li>your <b>name</b>, <b>section</b>, <b>course</b>, <b>date</b>, and <b>assignment number</b> will appear as comments at the top of your source code.
    <P>
    <li>the <b>purpose</b> of the program will also appear as comments at the top of your source code.
    <P>
    <li>follow closely the coding style of the text (e.g. programs 2-10 -- 2-13).
    <P>
    <li>compile your code with <tt>g++  -Wall </tt> <i>filename</i><tt>.cpp -o</tt> <i>filename</i> (ensure that there are no compiler warnings or errors)
    <P>
    <li>use <b>script</b> on <i>csci</i> to generate a file which contains the source code followed by a demonstration of the (possibly interactive) running of your program (on good test data). (for each program) You will print out and hand in these three files.

<h3>Objective:</h3>

This assignment is designed to provide you with experience <i>modularizing</i>
an existing program via <b>functions</b>.  Using functions, you will encapsulate
source code from your previous program, <b>hw3</b>, in which you approximated sine
and cosine.<br>
No conditionals, loops, or user defined data structures are
necessary to solve this problem.<br>

<h3>Problem:</h3>

Modify your <b>hw3</b> program to be modular via encapsulation of logical and
functional modules in the code by functions.<br>
The program behavior, as viewed by the user, should not change.<br>

<h3>Specifications:</h3>

The following will be functions:
<ul>
    <li> a function to encapsulate the input, output, and calculation, which calls:
    <ul>
	<li>a function to query for and read the angle.
	<li>a function to write the results.
	<li>a function to calculate the results, which calls:
	<ul>
	    <li>a function to convert the input from degrees to radians/4, where the 4 is a default parameter.
	    <li>a function to compute the 5 term expansion of sine AND cosine, where 5 is a default parameter (that we will use in a future modification), which calls:
	    <ul>
		<li>a function which computes each term using the previous term as a parameter.

	    </ul>
	    <li> a function each for the sin4x and cos4x formulae
	    <li>a function each for the trueSin and trueCos<br>
	    (you have used these math.h library functions already: sin(4*x) and cos(4*x))
	    <li>a function, called twice, to calculate the approxPercent for each.

	</ul>
    </ul>
</ul>

Document each function with a sentence explaining its purpose followed by
the purpose of each parameter and whether they are <tt>IN</tt>, <tt>OUT</tt>, or <tt>IN/OUT</tt>
respectively.<br>
Specify the <u>precondition</u> (Pre) and <u>postcondition</u> (Post) for each function.

<h3>SUBMIT:</h3>

<ul>
    <li> A listing of your source.
    <li> A copy {using the Unix [script] command} of your programs output for the following data values: <u>359</u>, <u>719</u>, <u>1</u>, <u>35641</u>, <u>35639</u>.

</ul>
