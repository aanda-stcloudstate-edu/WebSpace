<h2> Introduction:</h2>

This lab provides experience with <tt>struct</tt>s.

<h2> Lab Assignment:</h2>

<h4> Problem Motivation and Definition:</h4>

Structures are both a method of aggregating related variables, of not
necessarily the same type, under a common label.<br>
In fact, this aggregation can be considered to be a user-defined type.

The <tt>struct</tt> is now primarily a depricated legacy of C, supplanted by
the more powerful <tt>class</tt> facility.  However, because it is simpler to
work with, we will first work with <tt>struct</tt>s.

The problem we will be solving is that of finding successively more accurate
rational approximations to a floating point (<tt>double</tt>) value, e.g. Pi.

We will represent and access the data using structures and structure syntax.

Our specific goal is to mostly replicate this
<a href="http://www.isi.edu/~johnh/ABOUT/FEATURES/RATIONAL_PI/top_approximations.txt">table</a> of successively better
<a href="http://www.isi.edu/~johnh/ABOUT/FEATURES/RATIONAL_PI/index.html">rational approximations to Pi</a>.

<h4> Solution Specification:</h4>
<ol>
    <li> Create a new directory, <tt>lab11</tt>, and move to it.

    <li> Declare a <tt>struct</tt> containing the following:
    <ul>
	<li> <tt>int</tt> numerator
	<li> <tt>int</tt> denominator
	<li> <tt>double</tt> approximation to Pi
	<li> <tt>double</tt> magnitude of error of the approximation to Pi
    </ul>

    <li> Declare a 149 element array of the above structs.

    <li> Use <tt>Pi = 4 * atan(1.0)</tt> for the exact value of Pi.

    <li> In each successive array element, store the next best rational approximation.
    <li> Create a function that prints out the values in one of our structs to
    roughly resemble a row of the target table format.<br>
    (<i>place a slash "/" between the numerator and denominator</i>)<br>
    This function will receive our struct as its parameter.

    <li>Loop through the array printing each row in turn.

    <li>Compare your table with the reference table.

    <li>Once working, refactor your program to create a new version using
        <u>hierarchical</u> structures:
	<ul>
	    <li> the numerator and denominator should have their own struct
	    and print function
	    <li> the approximation and error should have their own struct
	    and print function
	    <li> the table print function should use the above two print functions
	</ul>

    <li> When correct, generate via <tt>enscript</tt> an HTML printout of the
    sources, and demonstrate, via <tt>script</tt>, the sources and the
    running of the program data.<br>
    Submit to D2L.
