<h2> Introduction:</h2>
This lab provides experience with
<ul>
    <li><u>multi-way selection</u> statements.
</ul>
<h2> Lab Assignment:</h2>

<h4> Problem Motivation and Definition:</h4>

<P> Knowing when to use a <i>switch</i> statement vs. an <i>else-if</i>
statement is important.  The switch statement, to select among several
alternatives, must be used only with integral values.  However, if there are
ranges of many integral values, we should instead use the else-if statement.

<P> In this lab we will solve a problem using both facilities in their
appropriate respective contexts.

<h4> Solution Specification:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
Create a new directory, <i>lab8</i>, and move to it.</li>

<li>
Develop a function which implements a solution to the problem expressed in
<b>Project 53</b> on page 223.
</li>

<li>
Your function should work for integer angles that are negative as well as for
those that are greater in magnitude than 360 degrees.
</li>

<li>
Develop another function to print the results.
</li>

<li>
Develop and run a test driver program which validates both functions.<br>
<ul>
<li> Your program will prompt the user for an input angle.
<li> In addition to the test values from the text, use angles &gt;360 and &lt;<0.
</ul>
</li>


<li>
When correct, generate a printout of the source, and demonstrate, via
typescript, the source and the running of the program data.
</li>

</ol>
