<h2> Introduction:</h2>

This lab provides experience with pointers.<br>
Problem numbers in the following assignment refer to the handout.

<h2> Lab Assignment:</h2>

<h4> Problem Motivation and Definition:</h4>

<P> <i>Pointers</i> are an essential and powerful type with a wealth of diverse
applications.  It is important to understand how they work.<br>
The following short programs will exercise and enhance your facility with them.

<h4> Solution Specification:</h4>
<ol>
    <li> Create a new directory, <tt>lab8</tt>, and move to it.

    <li> Perform project 79.

    <li> Perform project 80.  In the program, do this once for <tt>char</tt>
    data and once for <tt>long double</tt> data.  Also print out the size of
    one of the variables and the size of a pointer to it.

    <li> Write a function that:
    <ul>
	<li>reads an arbitrary number of <tt>int</tt>s (or <tt>char</tt>s)
	    from standard input
	<li>starts with a two element array off the heap.
	<li>if the array is filled and there is another number to add, then:
	<ul>
	    <li>create an array of twice the size;
	    <li>copy the contents of the old array into the new;
	    <li>add the new value;
	    <li>delete the old array.
	</ul>
	<li>return the pointer to the final array.
	<li>the final size will be available as a reference parameter.
	<li>display the array from outside the function.
    </ul>

    <li> Perform Problem 71.  Also write a function to display the triangle,
	accepting as parameters the pointer to it and the size.

    <li> When correct, generate via <tt>enscript</tt> an HTML printout of the
    sources, and demonstrate, via <tt>script</tt>, the sources and the
    running of the program data.<br>
    Submit to D2L.
</ol>
