<h2> Introduction:</h2>

This lab provides experience with <tt>class</tt>es.

<h2> Lab Assignment:</h2>

<h4> Problem Motivation and Definition:</h4>

The <u>class</u>, a variation on the <tt>struct</tt>, encourages the OOP
attribute of <i>data hiding</i> by having <u>data members</u> be
<i>private</i>by default.
<u>Methods</u> (<i>functions</i>) are <i>public</i>.<br>
The two chief methods are <i>accessors</i>, which read the private data,
and <i>mutators</i>, which modify the private data.

The problem we will be solving is that of creating a 3D moving point class.


<h4> Solution Specification:</h4>
<ol>
    <li> Create a new directory, <tt>lab12</tt>, and move to it.

    <li> Declare a <tt>class</tt> (<b>particle3d</b>) containing the following
    data members:
    <ul>
	<li> <tt>double</tt> x, y, and z position components
	<li> <tt>double</tt> x, y, and z velocity components
    </ul>

    <li> Declare the following methods for this class:
    <ul>
	<li>An <i>accessor</i> for each component
	<li>An <i>mutator</i> for each component
	<li>A <i>set</i> function for the class that uses the mutators to set all data member values.
	<li>A <i>distance</i> member that returns the point's distance from the origin
	<li>A <i>velocity</i> member that returns the point's speed.
	<li>A <i>movement</i> member that takes time as a parameter and moves the particle according to its speed.
	<li>A <i>where</i> member that prints a particles position and component velocity.
	<li>any other relavent functions that you can think of...
    </ul>

    <li> Declare the following external functions that use the class:
    <ul>
	<li> A function to return the distance between two particles
	<li> A function to return the speed difference between two particles
    </ul>


    <li>Once working, refactor your program to create a new version using
        <u>hierarchical</u> classes:
	<ul>
	    <li> the position and velocity should have their own classes
	    and methods
	</ul>

    <li> When correct, generate via <tt>enscript</tt> an HTML printout of the
    sources, and demonstrate, via <tt>script</tt>, the sources and the
    running of the program data.<br>
    Submit to D2L.
</ol>
