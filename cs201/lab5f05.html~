<h2>Introduction:</h2>
This lab exercises the ability to:
<ul>
    <li> use the software engineering technique of using <b>stubs</b> to
    reflect your <i>top down</i> design and ensure that the structure of your
    program is correct;
    <li> exploit functions to encapsulate functionality.
</ul>
<h2>Lab Assignment:</h2>

<ol>
<li>
Create a new directory, <i>lab5</i>, and move to it.</li>

<li>
Read the section, on page 164 of your C++ text, regarding the use of
<b>stubs</b> for <i>top-down development</i> of your programs.
<li>
<u>Copy</u> the <tt>stubs</tt> program from <tt>~aanda/cs201/labs/CF_stubs.cpp</tt>
to your <i>lab5</i> directory.
<li>
<u>Compile</u> and <u>run</u> this program to ensure that it works correctly.
<li>
<u>Copy</u> your stubs program to <tt>CF.cpp</tt>.
<li>
Use CF.cpp to perform Project 4-39 on page 172.
<li>
First, perform the project using only the three functions (in addition to
<tt>main()</tt>) provided in the stubs program.
<ol>
<li>
for <u>each</u> stub, in turn,
<ol>
<li>
replace that stub with the intended working contents,
<li>
recomplile,
<li>
run,
<li>
test.
</ol>
<li>
    when no stubs are left, you are finished.
</ol>
<li>
If time remains in lab, otherwise on your own time, further refine your top
down design by adding the three functions for input, output, and conversion
to both <tt>Celsius</tt> and <tt>Fahrenheit</tt> using the <b>stubs</b>
methodology, i.e.,
    <ol>
	<li>
	write, compile, and run a stubs version,
	<li>
	for each stub,
	<ol>
	<li>
	replace that stub with the intended working contents,
	<li>
	recomplile,
	<li>
	run,
	<li>
	test.
    </ol>
    <li>
    when no stubs are left, and the program is working correctly on a good
    set of test data, you are finished.
</ol>

<li>
For this second phase, you will need to declare and define functions which
may return a value and/or accept a value.  See Program 4-3 on Page 127 for
examples.<br>
<table border>
    <tr>
    <td>
    <b>Remember</b> that for every function <i>definition</i> at the
    <u>bottom</u> of your file, there must be a corresponding
    <i>declaration</i> at the <u>top</u>.
    </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<li>
What temperature will return the same value after Celsius or Fahrenheit
conversion?<br>
(<i>i.e., when is the Fahrenheit temp. equivalent to the Celsius temp.?</i>)
<li>
Our body temperature, when normal, is often stated as 98.6F.  What is this in Celsius?

</ol>
