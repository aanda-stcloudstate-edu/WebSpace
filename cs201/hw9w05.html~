For the following problem you will solve:
<ol type=I>
    <li>your <b>name</b>, <b>course</b>, <b>date</b>, and <b>assignment number</b> will appear as comments at the top of your source code.
    <P>
    <li>the <b>purpose</b> of the program will also appear as comments at the top of your source code.
    <P>
    <li>use <b>comments</b> <i>throughout</i> your code to describe what your code is doing.
    <P>
    <li>follow closely the coding style of the text.
    <P>
    <li>compile your code with <tt>g++  -Wall </tt> <i>filename</i><tt>.cpp -o</tt> <i>filename</i> (ensure that there are no compiler warnings or errors)
    <P>
    <li>use <b>script</b> on <i>csci</i> to generate a file which contains the source code followed by a demonstration of the interactive running of your program on <u>good test data</u>.  You will print out and hand in these files.
</ol>
<P>
Be neat.

	<LI>Chapter 9: <b>Pointers</b> (and <i>dynamic</i> arrays)
</OL>
<P>
Write a program to rank months by their temperature variability.<br>
<P>

Specifications:
<ol>
    <li>You will read the program data from a text file which contains daily
    temperatures for a year (Fairbanks, AK, 1965).<br>
    (the file uses "999" to indicate an entry for a non-existent day of the
    month)<br>
    The file is on <tt>csci</tt> at [<tt>~aanda/cs201/FAI1965.txt</tt>].</li>
    <li>Store the temperatures in a <u>ragged</u> array with each <i>row</i>
    holding all of the temperatures for a month.</li>
    <li>Write a function to compute the <u>standard deviation</u> of the
    temperatures for a month and save the results in a new array.</li>
    <li>Without reordering the std. dev. array, sort the months,
    with respect to their standard deviation,
    in ascending and descending order
    <br>[See Project 9.83 on Page 486].</li>
    <li>Print a pair of listings of the months
    (use their names not their ordinal numbers)
    alongside their respective standard deviations
    <ol>
	<li>In descending order, and
	<li>In ascending order.
    </ol>
    <li> Before the program exits, be sure to close any open files
    and to release back to the <i>heap</i> all dynamic memory objects.</li>
    <li> You can check your results via a spreadsheet.</li>
</ol>
