For the following two problems you will solve:
<ol type=I>
    <h5>General Documentation </h5>
    <li>The following must appear as <u>comments</u> at the top of each of your source code files:<br>
    <ul>
	<li><b>name</b>,</li>
	<li><b>course</b>,</li>
	<li><b>date</b>,</li>
	<li><b>section number</b>,</li>
	<li><b>assignment number</b>,</li>
	<li><b>full pathname on our server for its executable file</b>,</li>
	<li><b>brief description of the purpose for the program</b></li>
    </ul>
	(<i>Do this before you write any code</i>)</li>
    <li>the <b>purpose</b> of the program will also appear as <u>comments</u>
    at the top of your source code.<br>
    (<i>Do this before you write any code</i>)</li>
    <h5>Module Documentation</h5>
    <li>the purpose of important statements or blocks of statements in the
	source code of your program will be described by <u>comments</u>
	preceding them.<br>
	(<i>Do this before you write any code</i>)</li>
    <h5>Data Names </h5>
    <li>use <i>intelligent</i> <u>data names</u> which match the terminology
    of the user as closely as possible.</li>
    <P>
    <li>use <u>whitespace</u> and <i>consistent</i> <u>indenting</u> to enhance the
	readability of your code.</li>
    <li>For each program, at least one day prior to submitting your <u>source file</u> (as a syntax-highlighted PDF file) and <u>output</u> to the Homework 2 Assignment D2L dropbox,
    you will submit a <u>pseudocode</u> (<i>see</i> the top of Gaddis p. 136 {p. 134, 8th ed.}) text file for that problem to the Homework 2 D2L Assignment dropbox.
    Use that pseudocode as a foundation for the comments you include in your source code (<i>see</i> Prog. 3-28)</li>
    <P>
    <li>compile your code with <br><code>g++  -Wall -o</code> <code><i>filename</i> <i>filename</i></code><code>.cpp</code><br>(ensure that there are no compiler errors and as few warnings as possible)
    <P>
    <li>use <b>script</b> on our server to generate a file which contains
    a (<code>script</code> file) demonstration of the (possibly interactive)
    running of your program (on good test data).<br>
    (e.g. compare your computed <i>day of the week</i> with the output of the Unix <code>cal</code> function.)<br>
    There should be several testing runs.
    <li>Submit a PDF displaying your syntax-highlighted source code (<code>.cpp</code> file) for each program you write for this homework assignment.

    <h3>HW 2.1: Day of the Week</h3>
</center>
Write a program that, when a given a target date (<u>month</u>, <u>day</u>, <u>year</u>) is input, will display the <u>day of the week</u> for <i>that</i> date.<br>

You will implement the following algorithm:
<ol>
    <li>Calculate the <u>day of the week</u> for <b>December 31</b> of the <i>preceding</i> <u>year</u> by using the follwing formula:
    <span style="color:red;"> // which factors in the count of <i>leap years</i></span>
    <br>
	<center>
	    ( (year - 1) * 365 + &lfloor; (year - 1) / 4 &rfloor; - &lfloor; (year - 1) / 100 &rfloor; + &lfloor; (year - 1) / 400 &rfloor; ) % 7
	</center>
	where the result has the following interpretation:
	<ul>
	    <li> 0: Sunday
	    <li> 1: Monday
	    <li> 2: Tuesday
	    <li> 3: Wednesday
	    <li> 4: Thursday
	    <li> 5: Friday
	    <li> 6: Saturday
	</ul>
	<li> Now that you have the day for December 31 of the preceding year,
	you then calculate (<i>and add to the previous result</i>) the <b>sum</b> of the <u>total number of days</u> in <i>each</i> month <i>preceding</i> the <u>target month</u>.<br>
	    Use a <code>switch</code> statement having <i>fall-through</i> logic for this calculation.<br>
	    E.g. if the target month is December,<br>
	    the <code>switch</code> statement will execute the top <code>case</code> which adds the number of days in November to the sum,
	    <br>then control falls down to the next <code>case</code> which adds the number of days in October, and so on through January.<br>
	    For a target month of January the <code>switch</code> statement would add no days.<br>
	    For February, you will need to compute whether it has 28 or 29 days by adding one if the year is (divisible by 4 AND not by 100) OR the year is divisible by 400 .
	    <li> To this sum, now add the target day of the month.<br>
	    This number, <i>modulo seven</i>, is the day of the week for the target date using the above encoding scheme.
	    <li> For extra credit, use
	    <a href="http://web.stcloudstate.edu/aanda/cs201.html#enumerations"><code>enum</code> data types</a>
	    (<i>see </i>Gaddis, Section 11.11 {<small>11.12 in 8th ed.</small>}) for the
	    <u>days</u> of the week, the <u>months</u> of the year, and the <u>number of days</u> in each month.

    <h3>HW 2.2: Quadratic Formula</h3>
</center>
Write a program that tries to find the roots of the quadratic polynomial [ <i>a x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>b x + c</i> ] using the quadratic formula.<br>
Handle the following input coefficient conditions:
<ul>
    <li>If both <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are zero, output that "<code>there is no solution</code>".
    <li>If <i>a</i> only is zero, then there is a single real root, ( -<i>c/b</i> ).
    <li>If <i>b</i> only is non-zero, then there is a single real root which is <i>zero</i>.
    <li>If the <i>discriminant</i> [ (<i>b</i><sup>2</sup> - 4<i>ac</i>)] is zero,<br>
	then the two real roots will have the same value, ( -<i>b</i>/(2<i>a</i>) ).
    <li>If the <i>discriminant</i> is negative, output the roots as a complex conjugate pair.
    <li>else output the two distinct real roots.
</ul>
<P>
You can check your computed results with this <a href="https://www.symbolab.com/solver/quadratic-equation-calculator"><i>quadratic equation calculator</i></a><br>
<P>
A tutorial for the complex conjugate solution case is here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520115441/http://www.regentsprep.org/regents/math/algtrig/ate3/quadcomlesson.htm">Solving Quadratic Equations with Complex Roots</a><br>
<P>
Make sure that your set of test data exercises <i>every</i> branch of the logic!<br>
<P>
