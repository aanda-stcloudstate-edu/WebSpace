    <h2><u>Library Book Class</u></h2>
</DIV>
<HR>
You will create a class representing an Abstract Data Type for a library book.  This class will use several helper classes (via Class Collaboration [Section 14.8]).
<P>
The helper classes, that you will write, are a <u>date</u> class, a <u>name</u> class, and a <u>book</u> class.
<P>
Each of your classes will include:
<ul>
    <li>constructors
    <li>accessors
    <li>mutators
    <li>a display method which will use the accessor methods to neatly output its private data members.
    <li>a method to clear the data fields.
</ul>
<P>
The private data members of each class:
<P>
<pre>
class Name
{
    private:
	string first;
	string last;
    ...
}
</tt>
</pre>
<P>
<pre>
class Date
{
    private:
	int day;
	int month;
	int year;
    ...
}
</tt>
</pre>
<P>
<pre>
class Book
{
    private:
	string title;
	Name author;
	int year;
    ...
}
</tt>
</pre>
<HR>
<pre>
class LibraryBook
{
    private:
	Book book;
	Name borrower;
	Date borrowed;
	Date due;
	int id;
	bool isLoaned;
    ...
}
</tt>
</pre>
<h5><tt>LibraryBook</tt> methods</h5>
<ul>
    <li>constructors to create a <tt>LibraryBook</tt> object
    <li> accessors and mutators for each data member
    <li>(neatly) Print all information about <i>this</i> Libray Book
    <ul>
	<li>print <tt>borrower</tt> and date information only if on loan
    </ul>
    <li>Loan the book
    <ul>
	<li>parameters include <u>borrowing date</u>, <u>due date</u>, and <u>borrower</u>
	<li>Ensure that the due date is after the borrowing date<br>
	    (else do nothing other than print an error message)
	<li>if already out on loan, do nothing other than printing a message to that effect<br>
	    (can include due date).
    </ul>
    <li>Return the book
    <ul>
	<li>Expunge the <tt>borrower</tt> name information and set <tt>isLoaned</tt> to <tt>false</tt><br>
	    (if not loaned do nothing and print a message to that effect)
    </ul>
    <li>Renew the book
    <ul>
	<li>Update the <u>borrowing date</u> and <u>due date</u>.
    </ul>
    <li><tt>bool isOverdue(Date) const</tt> {compares parameter Date with borrowed Date}
    <ul>
	<li>if not loaned, print a message to that effect and return <tt>false</tt>
    </u>
</ul>
<HR>
The following are components of your <u>test driver</u> program and not the <tt>LibraryBook</tt> class.<br>
However, they will use the <tt>LibraryBook</tt> class.
<p>
Declare an array or <tt>vector</tt> of <tt>LibraryBook</tt> objects, where each element corresponds to a different book.
<p>
Write a non-class function to read a set of <tt>Book</tt>s from a file into the <tt>LibraryBook</tt> array/<tt>vector</tt>.<br>
(This will save you from having to manually input this information every time you run your program.)
<p>
Using the <tt>LibraryBook</tt> array/<tt>vector</tt>, write the following set of non-class functions (which will use <tt>LibraryBook</tt> class methods)
<ul>
    <li>Print all library book information (if not on loan, ignore date and borrower information)
    <li>Print all library book information for books not on loan
    <li>Print all library book information for books out on loan
    <li>Print all library book information for books overdue
    <li>Print the information for a library book with a given ID number
</ul>
<P>
Your <u>test driver</u> program should call these functions before, during, and after you perform some borrowing and returning transactions.
<P>
Feel free to add to this functionality, with a menuing system, with other functions that use the <tt>LibraryBook</tt> class, and/or print the library book information in order sorted by some key.
<HR>
How would you augment these classes to handle:
<ol>
    <li>books with multiple authors?
    <li>multiple copies of books in the library?
</ol>
<HR>
<P>
For the following problem you will solve:
<ol type=I>
    <li>At least a day prior to submission of your source code and test script, submit to your D2L dropbox <u>UML class diagrams</u> (Gaddis Section 13.15 &amp; p. 853) for your classes.
    <h5>General Documentation </h5>
    <li>your <b>name</b>, <b>course</b>, <b>date</b>, and
	<b>assignment number</b> will appear as <u>comments</u> at the top
	of your source code.<br>
	(<i>Do this before you write any code</i>)</li>
    <li>the <b>purpose</b> of the program will also appear as <u>comments</u>
    at the top of your source code.<br>
    (<i>Do this before you write any code</i>)</li>
    <h5>Module Documentation</h5>
    <li>the purpose of important statements or blocks of statements in the
	source code of your program will be described by <u>comments</u>
	preceding them.<br>
	(<i>Do this before you write any code</i>)</li>
    <h5>User Manual</h5>
    <li>Give examples of how to use your Library Book Class.  Include your methods.
    <h5>Data Names </h5>
    <li>use <i>intelligent</i> <u>data names</u> which match the terminology
    of the user as closely as possible.  This includes substituting descriptive constant identifiers for <i>magic numbers</i></li>
    <P>
    <li>use <u>whitespace</u> and <i>consistent</i> C-style <u>indenting</u> to enhance the
    readability of your code.  In <tt>vim</tt>:</li>
    <ul>
	<li><tt>:set sw=4</tt>
	<li><tt>:set cindent</tt>
    </ul>
    <P>
    <li>compile your code with <br><tt>g++  -Wall </tt> <i>filename</i><tt>.cpp -o</tt> <i>filename</i><br>(ensure that there are no compiler warnings or errors)
    <P>
    <li>use <b>script</b> on <i>csci</i> to generate a file which contains
    a (<tt>script</tt> file) demonstration of the (possibly interactive)
    running of your program (on good test data).
    There should be several runs.<cr>
    To display your source code, create a web page for each source file using
    the Unix command:<br>
    <center>
	<tt>enscript -Ecpp --color -W html -p</tt><i>file_name</i><tt>.cpp.html</tt> <i>file_name</i><tt>.cpp</tt>
    </center>
     You will submit these files to D2L.</li>
</ol>
<P>
Be neat.
<P>
<HR>
<ul>
    <li>Each function/method should use comments to specify its <u>preconditions</u> &amp; <u>postconditions</u>, and document its <u>parameters</u> (e.g. <tt>in</tt>, <tt>out</tt>, or <tt>in/out</tt>)
    <li>If you pass an array parameter to a function, and you don't intend to modify any of that array's elements, ensure that that array is passed <tt>const</tt>. (<i>see Gaddis p. 410</i>)
</ul>
