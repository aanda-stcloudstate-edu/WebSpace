For the following problem you will solve:
<ol type=I>
    <h5>General Documentation </h5>
    <li>your <b>name</b>, <b>course</b>, <b>date</b>, and
	<b>assignment number</b> will appear as <u>comments</u> at the top
	of your source code.<br>
	(<i>Do this before you write any code</i>)</li>
    <li>the <b>purpose</b> of the program will also appear as <u>comments</u>
    at the top of your source code.<br>
    (<i>Do this before you write any code</i>)</li>
    <h5>Module Documentation</h5>
    <li>the purpose of important statements or blocks of statements in the
	source code of your program will be described by <u>comments</u>
	preceding them.<br>
	(<i>Do this before you write any code</i>)</li>
    <h5>Data Names </h5>
    <li>use <i>intelligent</i> <u>data names</u> which match the terminology
    of the user as closely as possible.</li>
    <P>
    <li>use <u>whitespace</u> and <i>consistent</i> <u>indenting</u> to enhance the
	readability of your code.  In <code>vim</code>:</li>
    <ul>
	<li><code>:set sw=4</code>
	<li><code>:set cindent</code>
    </ul>
    <li>At least a day prior to submission of your source code and test script, submit to your D2L dropbox a flowchart for each problem in this assignment.
    <P>
    <li>compile your code with <br><code>g++  -Wall -o</code> <i>filename</i> <i>filename</i><code>.cpp</code><br>(ensure that there are no compiler errors and as few warnings as possible)
    <P>
    <li>use <b>script</b> on <i>csci</i> to generate a file which contains
    a (<code>script</code> file) demonstration of the (possibly interactive)
    running of your program (on good test data).<br>
    (Compare your computed <i>day of the week</i> with the output of the Unix <code>cal</code> function.)<br>
    There should be several runs.<br>
    To display your source code, create a web page for each source file using
    the Unix command:<br>
    <center>
	<code>enscript -Ecpp --color -W html -p </code><i>file_name</i><code>.cpp.html</code> <i>file_name</i><code>.cpp</code>
    </center>
    (for each program) You will submit these files.</li>
</ol>

    <h3>HW 3.1: Day of the Week</h3>
</center>
Write a program that, given a target date (month, day, year), will display the day of the week for that date.<br>

You will need the following algorithm:
<ol>
    <li>Calculate the day of the week for December 31 of the preceding year by using the follwing formula:<br>
	<center>
	    ( (year - 1) * 365 + &lfloor; (year - 1) / 4 &rfloor; - &lfloor; (year - 1) / 100 &rfloor; + &lfloor; (year - 1) / 400 &rfloor; ) % 7
	</center>
	where the result has the following interpretation:
	<ul>
	    <li> 0: Sunday
	    <li> 1: Monday
	    <li> 2: Tuesday
	    <li> 3: Wednesday
	    <li> 4: Thursday
	    <li> 5: Friday
	    <li> 6: Saturday
	</ul>
	<li> Now that you have the day for December 31 of the preceding year,
	    you then calculate (and add to the previous result) the sum of the total number of days in each month preceding the target month.<br>
	    Use a <code>switch</code> statement having <i>fall-through</i> logic for this calculation.<br>
	    E.g. if the target month is December,<br>
	    the <code>switch</code> statement will execute the top case which adds the number of days in November to the sum,
	    <br>then it falls down to the next case which adds the number of days in October, and so on through January.<br>
	    For a target month of January the <code>switch</code> statement would add no days.<br>
	    For February, you will need to compute whether it has 28 or 29 days by adding one if the year is divisible by 4 or by 400 but not by 100.
	    <li> To this sum, now add the target day of the month.<br>
	    This number, modulo seven, is the day of the week for the target date using the above encoding scheme.
	    <li> For extra credit, use <u>Enumerated Data Types</u> (<i>see Gaddis, Chapter 11.12</i>) for the
	    <u>days of the week</u>, the <u>months</u>, and the <u>number of days in each month</u>.

    <h3>HW 3.2: Quadratic Formula</h3>
</center>
Write a program that tries to find the roots of the quadratic polynomial [ <i>a x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>b x + c</i> ] using the quadratic formula.<br>
Handle the following input coefficient conditions:
<ul>
    <li>If both <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are zero, output that "<code>there is no solution</code>".
    <li>If <i>a</i> only is zero, then there is a single real root, ( -<i>c/b</i> ).
    <li>If <i>b</i> only is non-zero, then there is a single real root which is <i>zero</i>.
    <li>If the <i>discriminant</i> [ (<i>b</i><sup>2</sup> - 4<i>ac</i>)] is zero,<br>
	then the two real roots will have the same value, ( -<i>b</i>/(2<i>a</i>) ).
    <li>If the <i>discriminant</i> is negative, output the roots as a complex conjugate pair.
    <li>else output the two distinct real roots.
</ul>
<P>
You can check your computed results with this <a href="http://math.about.com/library/blquadraticcalc.htm"><i>quadratic equation calculator</i></a><br>
<P>
A tutorial for the complex conjugate solution case is here: <a href="http://www.regentsprep.org/regents/math/algtrig/ate3/quadcomlesson.htm">Solving Quadratic Equations with Complex Roots</a><br>
<P>
Make sure that your set of test data exercises every branch of the logic!<br>
