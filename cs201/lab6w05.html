Introduction:</h2>
This lab provides experience defining functions, significant digits, and
rounding.<p>
Rounding (modifying a value to the nearest number having the specified number
of digits, either after the decimal point or in total) is a commonly specified
requirement for display of information.<cr>
We quantify our certainty regarding the measurement of some quantity by
indicating that we are certain about its accuracy to an estimated number of
<i>significant</i> digits.  Displaying more digits would be misleading.<br>
Because we do not want to ever make it look like a value has more significant
digits than it actually does, we lop off the all those terminal uncertain digits
(while rounding) and replace them with zeros.
The following functions will <i>round</i> a given value in both of the above
ways respectively.
<h2>
Lab Assignment:</h2>

<ol>
<ol>
<li>
Create a new directory, <i>lab6</i>, and move to it.</li>

<li>
Write a test driver program to verify the correct behaviour of the two
functions,<br>
<tt><u>round_ADP(fpnum,digits)</u></tt>
(which <i>rounds</i> the <b>double</b> value <tt>fpnum</tt> to <tt>digits</tt>
digits <i>after the decimal point</i>) and<br>
<tt><u>round_SD(fpnum,digits)</u></tt> 
(which <i>rounds</i> the <b>double</b> value <tt>fpnum</tt> to <tt>digits</tt>
<i>significant digits</i>).<br>
The driver program requests from the user a floating point number
(to round) and an integer in the interval
[0-6] specifying the number of decimal places to round to,
or significant digits to round to.<p>
After verifying that <tt>round_ADP()</tt> is working correctly,
you will use it in <tt>round_SD()</tt>.
</li>

<ol>
    <li> For <tt>round_ADP()</tt>:
    <ul>
	<li>Base your equation on expressions from Exercise 21 of Section 4-12 of your C++ text.
	<li>Notice that the power of 10 used is equal to the number of digits to round to.
	<li>What function can you use to generate powers of 10?
	<li><i>Note: don't forget to include necessary libraries</i>
    </ul>
    <li> For <tt>round_SD()</tt>:
    <ul>
	<li>Shift (normalize) <tt>fpnum</tt> to be, in absolute value,
	    less than 1.0, but greater than or equal to 0.1
	    <ul>
		<li>Which standard math library function indicates the number of
		<i>decimal</i> digits that a value starts to the left or right
		    of a decimal point?<br>
		    (i.e. 123.45 would yield 2 and 0.012345 would yield -2)
		<li>Take that value, plus one, as the number of digits to shift.
	    </ul>
	    <li>Now, call <tt>round_ADP()</tt> to shift to the specified
	        number of digits.
	    <li> Finally, shift the value <i>back</i> to the original scaling.
    </ul>
</li>

<li>
Ensure that your program and functions have updated <u>comment </u>headers
describing your identifying information, the date, and the purpose of the
program or function.<br>
Each user defined function should document the preconditions, and what each
parameter is and whether they are IN, OUT, or IN/OUT. <br>

<li>
Use one <b>function</b> to <u>prompt</u> the user with explicit instructions to
<u>input</u> the positive floating point decimal number to be rounded
<i>and</i> the number of digits to round to.<br>
The number of digits to round should be between zero and six inclusive <i>[0-6]</i>.
</li>

<li>
The test driver output will display:
    <ul>
	<li>
	the original number,
	<li>
	the number of digits to round, and
	<li>
	the rounded value without shifting,
	<li>
	the rounded value with shifting.
    </ul>
</li>

<li>
<b>Note</b>:
<ul>
<li>
Don't forget to place the <u>prototype declaration</u>
for each function above the function header of the main program.
<li>
Use <b>stubs</b> (See Program 4-13 on pg. 165) to design from the top down
and ensure that the functional structure is working at an intermediate stage.  When the stub form is working properly, replace each with the complete code and test.
</ul>
</li>

<li>
Compile and run.<br>
Ensure that the program is working correctly using a good set of test data.<br>
</li>


<li>
When correct, generate a printout of the source, and demonstrate, via
typescript, the running of the program.</li>
</ol>
