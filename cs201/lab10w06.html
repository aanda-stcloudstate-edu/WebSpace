<h2> Introduction:</h2>
This lab provides experience with <u>arrays</u>.
<h2> Lab Assignment:</h2>

<h4> Problem Motivation and Definition:</h4>

The <u>array</u> is a <i>data structure</i> which allows us to aggregate
a set of related items of the same type under a common label.  We distinguish
between the items by using an index which corresponds to a sequence index.

<P> Loops and arrays work hand-in-hand.  We use loop indices in array index
expressions to systematically refer to array elements.

<P> In this lab we will use a loop to reverse the elements of an array in-place.

<h4> Solution Specification:</h4>
Create a new directory, <i>lab10</i>, and move to it.<br>

Develop a <tt>reverse_array</tt> function which implements a solution to the
problem expressed in <b>Problem 29</b> on page 407.
<ol type=I>
    <li> <b>Input:</b>
    <ol type=1>
    <li>Prompt the user to enter up to a maximum
    (<i>determined by your array size</i>)
    number of integers, ending with an <i>end-of-file</i> character.</li>
    <li>Use a loop to read those integers.</li>
    <li>Maintain a running count of the number of integers entered.</li>
    <li>If the user tries to enter more than the maximum:
    <ol type=a>
	<li>Discard that entry.
	<li>Send the user an informative message via the <u>standard error</u>
       	stream.
	<li>Exit the loop.
    </ol>
    <li>Use another loop to print out the entries, ten to a row.
</ol>
<li><b>Reverse:</b>
<ol>
    <li>
    Use a loop in our <tt>reverse_array</tt> function to select array elements
    to swap.
    </li>

    <li>
    Use the <tt>exchange()</tt> function from page 142 to perform the element swaps.
    </li>
</ol>
<li><b>Output:</b> use a loop to print out the reversed entries,
    ten to a row.  </li>
<li><b>Testing:</b> ensure that your program works for the boundary cases,
    and for even and odd numbers of entries.</li>
<li><b>Improvement:</b> You could modify your program to have a more user
    friendly user interface which allows the user to verify that the input was
    correct and, if not, specify an index and value to change.
    (<i>ensure that the index is valid</i>)<br>
    This can be repeated as many times as necessary.
    </li>
</ol>
