For each of the following problems you will solve:
<ol type=I>
    <li>your <b>name</b>, <b>course</b>, <b>date</b>, and <b>assignment number</b> will appear as comments at the top of your source code.
    <P>
    <li>the <b>purpose</b> of the program will also appear as comments at the top of your source code.
    <P>
    <li>use <b>comments</b> <i>throughout</i> your code to describe what your code is doing.
    <P>
    <li>follow closely the coding style of the text.
    <P>
    <li>compile your code with <tt>g++  -Wall </tt> <i>filename</i><tt>.cpp -o</tt> <i>filename</i> (ensure that there are no compiler warnings or errors)
    <P>
    <li>use <b>script</b> on <i>csci</i> to generate a file which contains the source code followed by a demonstration of the interactive running of your program on <u>good test data</u>.  You will print out and hand in these files.
</ol>
<P>
Be neat.

    <LI>Chapter 8: Arrays (static)
</OL>
<P>
Write a program to perform Project 51 in Chapter 8 (page 411), with the
following addenda:
<ul>
    <li> Assume that the scores are integers between 0 and 100 inclusive.
    <li> Also, compute and print the geometric and harmonic means of the scores.
    <br> (<b>Note:</b> zero scores can't be used in the harmonic mean)
    <li> Also, use the average to compute the standard deviation too.<br>
    (Use formula 5 from
   <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/StandardDeviation.html">here</a>)
	<li> Print the number of entries, mean, median, mode, and st. dev.
	<li> You may use Standard I/O.
	<li> Exception handling:
	<ul>
	    <li> Warn the user if there are no entries
	    <li> Warn the user if there are more than 50 entries in the file
	    <br> and that only the first 50 will be used
	</ul>
	<li> Show that your program will work properly for:
	<ul>
	    <li> an empty data file
	    <li> a data file with one entry (st. dev. = 0)
	    <li> a data file with two entries
	    <li> a data file with three entries
	    <li> a data file with 49 entries
	    <li> a data file with 50 entries
	    <li> a data file with 51 entries
	</ul>
	<li> You can check your results using a spreadsheet
    </ul>
