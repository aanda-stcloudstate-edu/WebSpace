REQUIRED TEXTS: * Starting out with C++:
		    From Control Structures through Objects,  9th Ed.,
		    by Tony Gaddis,
                    Addison Wesley, 2018.
OBJECTIVES:
    This course uses high-level language C++ and appropriate mathematical
    concepts to introduce the fundamentals of computer science, algorithm
    design, problem solving and elementary data structures and algorithms. 
    Main topics include: basic features of the UNIX operating system, editing,
    compiling, and running of C++ programs, top-down design, structure of a
    C++ program,  basic C++ constructs, standard input output operations,
    program modularity, Data abstraction, elementary data structures, and
    dynamic data structures. Sorting and searching. Error handling and
    recovery. Time and space analysis of algorithms and big-O notation.
    Linked and sequential implementations of the list, stack, queue, set,
    and matrix abstract data types. Time management.

    

TOPICS:
    * A basic working knowledge of the UNIX operating system, including the
      use of files and an editor (vi/vim).
    * Introduction to C++: Program elements and structure. Variables, assignment, and arithmetic operators. (Gaddis, Chs. 1, 2)
    * Expressions and data types. (Gaddis, Ch. 3)
    * Control flow in C++: if statements. (Gaddis, Ch. 4)
    * Control flow: Loops. (Gaddis, Ch. 5)
    * Functions, parameters, returned values, and more. (Gaddis, Ch. 6)
    * Arrays. (Gaddis, Ch. 7)
    * Introduction to the Personal Software Process (PSP) (Humphrey, Chs. 1, 2), and one more chapter from Humphrey each week after its introduction.
    * Sorting and searching in arrays. (Gaddis, Ch. 8)
    * Time complexity and the big-O notation.
    * Pointers. (Gaddis, Ch. 9)
    * Characters and strings. (Gaddis, Ch. 10)
    * Records (structs) and arrays of records. (Gaddis, Ch. 11)
    * Classes. (Gaddis, Ch. 13)
    * Linked lists. (Gaddis, Ch. 17)
    * Stacks and queues. (Gaddis, Ch. 18) 
    

PREREQUISITES:
    All students in this class must have either:
    * passed the prerequisite course as listed in the course description,
      MATH 112 {College Algebra}, or higher.
    * received transfer credit for MATH 112 or higher
    * been certified by the MATH department that they have math readiness
      for math classes which list MATH 112 or higher as a prerequisite.
      This is usually accomplished by scoring higher than 11 on the Calculus
      Readiness Placement Exam offered by the MATH department.
    If you are taking this course for your major, you should be enrolled in MATH 271 {Discrete Mathematics}
    {<A HREF="https://catalog.stcloudstate.edu/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&topicgroupid=373&entitytype=CID&entityid=26241&loaduseredits=False">Discrete Mathematics</A>}
    AND either CSCI 200, ECE 102, CNA 267, IS 251 or permission.

CLASS ACCOUNTS:
    All submitted work for this class must be done using the [csci2] server
    account assigned for this class.

CLOSED LABS:
    We will spend time in the lab on Monday every week.  These labs cannot
    be made up.  Attendance will be taken.

ASSIGNMENTS:
    In addition to the projects assigned during the closed labs, you will
    also be expected to complete programming projects on your own outside
    of class time.  The programs are due according to the D2L Dropbox schedule.
    No allowance will be made for computer down time, so plan
    ahead.  Late work may be penalized or may not be accepted.

ACADEMIC HONESTY:
    You are expected to do your own homework.  If you copy someone else's
    work or allow someone else to copy your work, you are being academically
    dishonest and will be subject to severe disciplinary action which may
    include any or all of: no credit for the work in question, a failing grade
    for the course, notification to the university that you have violated your
    Code of Conduct.  Use of recording devices during exams is prohibited.
    If you must quote or paraphrase another source, citation is essential,
    otherwise plagiarism has been committed.  You are expected to be familiar
    with your rights and obligations as outlined in the
     <A HREF="https://www.stcloudstate.edu/studenthandbook/code/default.aspx">Student Code of Conduct</A> - specifically the <A HREF="https://www.stcloudstate.edu/studenthandbook/code/prohibited.aspx">Prohibited Student Conduct</A> section, and the <A HREF="https://www5.stcloudstate.edu/Policies/SCSU/Viewer.aspx?id=6">Academic Integrity policy</A> within.

DECORUM: Conduct yourself so as not to distract others. In particular
    * <b><u>Turn off</u></b> all cell phones, watch alarms, and similar devices.
    * Do not engage in distracting activities like reading a newspaper
      or sleeping. (some of you snore...)
    * Arrive for class on time, and be ready to begin.
      If you must be late, please enter quietly.
    * If you are early, sit toward the middle of a row.
    * Do not start packing up before class ends.
    * Please be sensitive to your fellow students by being judicious in
      your choice of slogans and images on your clothing.
      (I'm all for freedom of expression, really, but other students
       have to be here, and they have the right to a non-threatening
       environment)

ATTENDANCE:
    You are responsible for knowing what happens at each class meeting.
    (Your fellow students can be excellent resources for helping you
     acquire notes from a class you missed.)
    (Most professors will at least raise eyebrows at the question:
     "Did I miss anything important?")

READING QUIZZES:
    There will be a quiz of assigned reading prior to the
    coverage of most chapters.  These quizzes will have multiple-choice answers to questions.
    These quizzes will be announced at least the day of the class period prior.
    These quizzes will usually be administered prior to discussion of the material covered by the quiz.
    Peer grading may be used at the discretion of the instructor.

EXAMS:
    There will be two intermediate hourly exams and a comprehensive
    final exam.
    Exams will be based on the notes; that is, on the presentations in class
    as well as on the content in the assigned readings.
    For each exam, a 8.5" x 11" review sheet will be allowed plus the review
    sheets from the previous exams.
	Only material from lecture notes (slides and written in lecture), instructor provided supplements,
	    or the course textbooks are allowed on each review sheet.
	Any answers to questions from exams for this course given in previous semesters which appear on your
	    review sheet are considered to be examples of academic dishonesty.
    Calculators will be neither necessary nor allowed.
    Make-up exams will be given in only in extreme (or university
    sanctioned) circumstances and only with prior notice.

GRADING:
        Your grade will be determined by the contributions of your scores
        on assignments,  quizzes, intermediate and final exams.
        Makeup of tests, quizzes, and exams are by prior arrangement only.
	Extra credit, if offered, will be announced and available to all
	students, and only during the duration of the course.

        Assignments             15%
        Quizzes                 10%

<h3>Violence Statement</h3>
<pre>
In the event that you choose to write or speak about having survived sexualized violence,
including rape, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, and specify that this
violence occurred while you were an SCSU student, federal and state education laws require that,
as your instructor, I notify the Title IX officer, Ellyn Bartges. 

She (or her designee) will contact you to let you know about accommodations and support services at SCSU
and possibilities for holding accountable the person who harmed you.

If you do not want the Title IX Officer notified, instead of disclosing this information to your instructor,
you can speak confidentially with the following people on campus and in the community. 

They can connect you with support services and discuss options for holding the perpetrator accountable.
