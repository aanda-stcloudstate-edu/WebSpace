For the following problem you will solve:
<ol type=I>
    <h5>General Documentation </h5>
    <li>your <b>name</b>, <b>course</b>, <b>date</b>, and
	<b>assignment number</b> will appear as <u>comments</u> at the top
	of your source code.<br>
	(<i>Do this before you write any code</i>)</li>
    <li>the <b>purpose</b> of the program will also appear as <u>comments</u>
    at the top of your source code.<br>
    (<i>Do this before you write any code</i>)</li>
    <h5>Module Documentation</h5>
    <li>the purpose of important statements or blocks of statements in the
	source code of your program will be described by <u>comments</u>
	preceding them.<br>
	(<i>Do this before you write any code</i>)</li>
    <h5>Data Names </h5>
    <li>use <i>intelligent</i> <u>data names</u> which match the terminology
    of the user as closely as possible.</li>
    <P>
    <li>use <u>whitespace</u> and <i>consistent</i> C-style <u>indenting</u> to enhance the
    readability of your code.  In vim:</li>
    <ul>
	<li><tt>:set sw=4</tt>
	<li><tt>:set cindent</tt>
    </ul>
    <P>
    <li>compile your code with <br><tt>g++  -Wall </tt> <i>filename</i><tt>.cpp -o</tt> <i>filename</i><br>(ensure that there are no compiler warnings or errors)
    <P>
    <li>use <b>script</b> on <i>csci</i> to generate a file which contains
    a (<tt>script</tt> file) demonstration of the (possibly interactive)
    running of your program (on good test data).
    There should be several runs.<cr>
    To display your source code, create a web page for each source file using
    the Unix command:<br>
    <center>
	<tt>enscript -Ecpp --color -W html -p</tt><i>file_name</i><tt>.cpp.html</tt> <i>file_name</i><tt>.cpp</tt>
    </center>
    (for each program) You will submit these files.</li>
</ol>
<P>
Be neat.

    <li>Poker Hand Selection<br>
    Using an incomplete running of the "inverse selection sort" permutation
    algorithm I presented in class, generate a user-specified number of
    random poker hands from the same 52 card deck.
    This algorithm performs random selection <i>without</i> replacement.
    <ol>
	<li>The user will enter:
	<ul>
	    <li>a random seed
	    <li>the number of cards per hand
	    <li>the number of players (hands)
	    <li>whether Ace is high or low
	    <li>whether to sort each hand first by suit or by rank
	</ul>
	<li>Ensure that there are enough cards in the deck for the number of players, <i>else</i> complain &amp; exit.
	<li>Ensure that there are no duplicated cards between and within hands.
	<li>Display each hand sorted from low to high
	<li>Extra Credit: Use ennumerated types.
	<li>Later (in a future assignment), we will use
	<a href="http://www.pagat.com/vying/pokerrules.html">the rules of poker</a>
	to determine a winning hand for each deal (more than one player).  Display the total number of each category of hand (two pair, full house, flush, etc.)
	for all hands and deals.  Do they roughly match the
	<a href="http://wizardofodds.com/poker">expected probabilities</a>?
