<h2> Introduction:</h2>
This lab provides experience with arrays and iteration.
The task is to compute a sequence of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number">prime numbers</a>
via the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">Sieve of Eratosthenes</a>.
<h2> Lab Assignment:</h2>

<h4> Problem Motivation and Definition:</h4>

<P> <i>Public key cryptography</i> is based on prime numbers and the difficulty of factoring large compound numbers into primes.<br>
The <u>Sieve of Eratosthenes</u> is an ancient algorithm for sequentially
finding primes.<br>
This algorithm will require <b>arrays</b> and <b>iteration</b> through those arrays.

<h4> Solution Specification:</h4>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>
Create a new directory, <tt>lab6</tt>, and move to it.</li>


<li>
Create a Sieve_of_Eratosthenes function which accepts two integer arrays.<br>
One array will be populated by the function with the contiguous sequence of
integers starting with 2 up to a limiting value (passed into the function).<br>
The other array will be a sequential list of primes starting with 2.  The number of primes found will be passed out of the list (it is also the number of array elements used in this array).<br>
Implement in this function the following 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes#Algorithm">Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm</a>.<p>
<b>Note:</b> to find all the primes up to <b><i>N</i></b>, it is only necessary
to eliminate prime factors up to <tt>sqrt</tt>(<b><i>N</i></b>). (<i>can you deduce why this is so?</i>)
</li>

<li>
Write a program which prompts the user for a positive integer (&gt;1)
to search for primes up to (limited by the static size of the arrays).<br>
The program will then print, with message, the number of primes found,
followed on the next lines by the set of consecutive primes, <i>ten per line</i>.  <br>
Be sure to avoid using
<a href="http://foldoc.org/?magic+number">magic numbers</a> in declaring your arrays.
</li>

<li>
Paste the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prime_numbers">list of the first thousand prime numbers</a>
into a file.<br>
See <b>Chapter 12</b> for information on how to read the contents of this file into your program.<br>
Compare up to the first thousand primes found by your function with those from the reference list in the file.<br>
Inform the user whether their list of primes is OK up to the first 1000.
</li>

<li>
When correct, generate via <tt>enscript</tt> an HTML printout of the source,
and demonstrate, via <tt>script</tt>, the source and the running of the program
data.<br>
Submit to D2L.
</li>

</ol>
