 Programming assignment 8

 CSCI 201 [1,3] Fall 2003

Objective:

This assignment is designed to exercise your facility with
one and two dimensional arrays.

Problem:

Design a program which reads daily temperature lows for a
year from a text file, computes summary statistics from
the file, and then writes its contents and its summary statistics
to another text file.

Specifications:

1. Copy the temperature file from ~cs201400/FAI1965.txt to
  your directory

2. Your program will:

  (a) read in the file as a text file (don't use cin)

  (b) print the output as a text file (don't use cout),
    changing the month numbers in the top line to the
    respective three character month names.
    Also, print the 999 values, which indicate no
    day of that month in the table, as a triple of asterisks.

  (c) under each month, your program will print that month's:

    i. minimum

    ii. maximum

    iii. arithmetic mean (average) (see p. 396)

    iv. median (see p. 396)

    v. mode (see p. 396)

  (d) In the first column, your program will print the labels
    for the above statistics

  (e) On lines following the above statistics, your program
    will print, with adequate labeling, the global statistics
    for the file (e.g. maximum temp. for the year)

  (f) Document your code liberally.  Use white space effectively.

3. You will then turn in a typescript of the program source
  and the output file.

Notes:


* The months have different counts of days. You can use the
  999 values of extra days in the month as a sentinel, but
  don't include them in your calculations. The n
  in the above formula and the formulae for the other statistics
  will represent the number of actual days in each respective
  month, or the number of days in the year.

* The mode and median are described in problem 8-36 in the
  text. You may use any sort in computing the median.

EXTRA CREDIT (due at time of final)

Partial:

Use the smallest possible dynamic array (see Section 9-14, p. 436)
for use as the frequency array in computing the mode.

Full: Modify the entire program to use dynamic rather than static arrays.
