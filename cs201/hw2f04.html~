For each of the following problems you will solve:
<ol type=I>
    <li>your <b>name</b>, <b>course</b>, <b>date</b>, and <b>assignment number</b> will appear as comments at the top of your source code.
    <P>
    <li>the <b>purpose</b> of the program will also appear as comments at the top of your source code.
    <P>
    <li>follow closely the coding style of the text (e.g. programs 2-10 -- 2-13).
    <P>
    <li>compile your code with <tt>g++  -Wall </tt> <i>filename</i><tt>.cpp -o</tt> <i>filename</i> (ensure that there are no compiler warnings or errors)
    <P>
    <li>use <b>script</b> on <i>csci</i> to generate a file which contains the source code followed by a demonstration of the (possibly interactive) running of your program (on good test data). (for each program) You will print out and hand in these three files.
</ol>
<P>
Be neat.

    <li>Modify Program 2-12 with the following changes:
    <ul>
	<li>include the &ltcmath&gt library
	<li>replace the literal value for pi with the global memory constant <br>
	<tt>const double Pi = 4 * atan(1);</tt>
	<li>also print the volume and surface area of a sphere with the same radius. (find the formulae using your own research)
