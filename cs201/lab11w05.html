<h2> Introduction:</h2>
The first section of this lab provides experience with one-dimensional arrays.
<h2> Lab Assignment:</h2>

<h4> Problem Motivation and Definition:</h4>


<P> In Lab 4, we read in a decimal integer but interpreted it as a binary
number.  We then computed and output its decimal value.<br>
In this lab we are going to perform a sequence of two successive modifications
to our Lab 4 program exploiting our knowledge of more C++ language features
which which improve the <i>readability</i>, <i>robustness</i>, and
<i>generality</i> of our Lab 4 program.

<P>
In the first section of this lab, we will modify our Lab 4 program to use an
array within a loop rather than a set of related variables and code blocks.
We will also make it more robust by checking the consistency of our input.
<P>
In the second section of this lab, we will further modify our program to make
it more general by adding the ability to convert from a range of bases.

<h4> Solution Specification:</h4>
<ol>
    <li> Create a new directory, <i>lab11</i>, and move to it.</li>
    <li>part I: Modify a program solving 
    <a href="http://web.stcloudstate.edu/aanda/cs201/lab4w05.html">lab 4</a>.
    <ol>
	<li>Use an array to represent the bit values.
	<li>Use loops wherever possible.
	<li>You may use the
	<a href="http://web.stcloudstate.edu/aanda/cs201/convert2to10.html">example program</a>
	code as your base code.
	<li>Ensure the consistency of the input by checking that each digit has the value of either zero or one.<br>
	<i>(be sure to test that you are catching bad input)</i>

    </ol>
    <li>Part II: Now add generality by adding the ability to convert from a range of bases.
    <ol>
	<li>Prompt the user for a base in the range [2,10]
	<li>Ensure that it is in that range.
	<li>Modify the program to give the correct decimal value
    </ol>
    <li>Part III: Now extend the range of bases to 16.
    <ol>
	<li>You will want to use character I/O for this part to ensure the
	    consistency of the input.
    </ol>
</ol>
