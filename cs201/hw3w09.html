For the following problem you will solve:
<ol type=I>
    <h5>General Documentation </h5>
    <li>your <b>name</b>, <b>course</b>, <b>date</b>, and
	<b>assignment number</b> will appear as <u>comments</u> at the top
	of your source code.<br>
	(<i>Do this before you write any code</i>)</li>
    <li>the <b>purpose</b> of the program will also appear as <u>comments</u>
    at the top of your source code.<br>
    (<i>Do this before you write any code</i>)</li>
    <h5>Module Documentation</h5>
    <li>the purpose of important statements or blocks of statements in the
	source code of your program will be described by <u>comments</u>
	preceding them.<br>
	(<i>Do this before you write any code</i>)</li>
    <h5>Data Names </h5>
    <li>use <i>intelligent</i> <u>data names</u> which match the terminology
    of the user as closely as possible.</li>
    <P>
    <li>use <u>whitespace</u> and <i>consistent</i> C-style <u>indenting</u> to enhance the
    readability of your code.  In <tt>vim</tt>:</li>
    <ul>
	<li><tt>:set sw=4</tt>
	<li><tt>:set cindent</tt>
    </ul>
    <P>
    <li>compile your code with <br><tt>g++  -Wall </tt> <i>filename</i><tt>.cpp -o</tt> <i>filename</i><br>(ensure that there are no compiler warnings or errors)
    <P>
    <li>use <b>script</b> on <i>csci</i> to generate a file which contains
    a (<tt>script</tt> file) demonstration of the (possibly interactive)
    running of your program (on good test data).
    There should be several runs.<cr>
    To display your source code, create a web page for each source file using
    the Unix command:<br>
    <center>
	<tt>enscript -Ecpp --color -W html -p</tt><i>file_name</i><tt>.cpp.html</tt> <i>file_name</i><tt>.cpp</tt>
    </center>
     You will submit these files to D2L.</li>
</ol>
<P>
Be neat.

For the following project, exploit <u>functions()</u> as much as possible to enhance the modularization of your design.<br>
Your <tt>main()</tt> function body should consist primarily of declarations, initializations, and function calls.

    <li><i>Birthday Paradox</i> Simulation<br>
    The
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox"><i>birthday paradox</i></a>,
    states that given a group of 23 (or more) randomly chosen people, the
    probability is more than 50% that at least two of them will have the same
    birthday.<br>
    Your task is to use simulation to corroborate the mathematical analysis.<br>
    Algorithm:
    <ol>
	<li>Include the following libraries: <tt>&lt;iostream&gt;,&lt;iomanip&gt;,&lt;cstdlib&gt;,&lt;cmath&gt;,</tt>.
	<li>Input (and echo to the output):
	<ul>
	    <li>the number of times to run the simulation
	    <li>a non-negative integer seed value to be used as the input parameter for <tt>srand()</tt>.
	</ul>
	<li>Repeat the following simulation the number of times specified by the input: 
	<ol>
	    <li>Initialize a 365 (<i>no leap day</i>) element Boolean array to all <tt>false</tt>.
	    <li>Declare and initialize a 100 element integer frequency array.
	    <li><u>Randomly</u> mark birthdays (<tt>true</tt>) in the 365 element Boolean array until there's a duplicate.
	    <li>Every time there's not a duplicate birthday, increment the frequency array element whose index is the current number of unmatched birthdays. 
	    <li>When there is a duplicate, break out of the loop.
	</ol>
	<li>When finished, store, in a new (<tt>double</tt>) array, the ratio of each value
	 in the frequency array to the total number of runs.<br>
       	This value will be a the simulated probability of not-matching for that many birthdays.
	<li>In another array of the same size and type, store the theoretical probability of not-matching.
	( N = number of birthdays not-matching) computed via the relations:
	<ul>
	    <li> The probability that 0 or 1 birthday won't match is 1.
	    <li> The probability that 2 birthdays won't match is (1 - 1/365) = (1 - ({N=2} - 1)/365) = P(2).
	    <li> The probability that 3 birthdays won't match is (1 - 1/365)*(1 - 2/365) = P(2)*(1 - ({N=3} -1)/365).
	    <li> The probability that N &gt; 0 birthdays won't match is P(N - 1)*(1 - (N -1)/365).
	</ul>
	<li>output a table where for each row:
	<ul>
	    <li>column 1 is the number of birthdays not-matching (<i>starting with 2</i>),
	    <li>column 2 is the respective theoretical probability
	    <li>column 3 is the respective simulated probability
	    <li>column 4 is the respective absolute error {theoretical - simulated}
	    <li>column 5 is the respective relative error {<tt>fabs</tt>((theoretical - simulated) / theoretical)}
	</ul>
	<li>Can you duplicate the <a href="http://web.stcloudstate.edu/aanda/cs201/hw3.1f09.txt">instructors output</a>?<br>
	(you'll need to use the following I/O manipulators: <tt>scientific, setw(), setprecision()</tt>)
	<li>Answer the following questions:
	<ol>
	    <li>What happens to the magnitude of the errors when you significantly increase the number of runs?
	    <li>Run the simulations again using different random seeds.  What happens?
	    <li>How would you modify your program to simulate the probabilities that M &gt; 2 birthdays would-not match?
	</ol>
    </ol>

Use the following function to compute a <u>random integer</u> in the interval [0, bound):
<pre>
<tt>
int irand2bound(int bound)
{
    return static_cast&lt;int&gt;( rand() / (RAND_MAX + 1.0) * bound );
}
