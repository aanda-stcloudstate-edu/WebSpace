Introduction:</h2>
This lab exercises informative user communication, the two integer division
operators, and compound assignment expressions.
<h2>
Lab Assignment:</h2>

<ol>
<ol>
<li>
Create a new directory, <i>lab4</i>, and move to it.</li>

<li>
Write&nbsp; a working program which converts a binary number to decimal
using the following algorithm (as expressed in Appendix D-2 of our C++
text and your lecture notes):</li>

<ol>
<li>
You can use the <tt>~aanda/cs201/source/CH03/p03-10.c++</tt> program from  page 102-103 of our C++ text as a
template for this program.&nbsp; Be sure to copy it over to a new file
with another name.&nbsp; {<i>This is an example of code reuse</i>}</li>

<li>
Ensure that your program has updated <u>comment </u>headers describing
your identifying information, the date, and the purpose of the program.</li>

<li>
<u>Prompt</u> the user with explicit instructions on entering a binary
number up to <u>eight</u> digits long as a <u>contiguous</u> sequence of
ones and zeros.&nbsp; The leading digit must be nonzero. {<i>or it will
be interpreted as an octal number</i>}</li>

<li>
<u>Read</u> the input as if it were a decimal integer {<i>that has only
ones and zeros as digits</i>}</li>

<li>
Store the value of each bit in its own integer variable using the following
algorithm:</li>

<ol>
<li>
the rightmost bit value is the remainder of dividing the input integer
by 10 {<i>use the <b>%</b> operator</i>}</li>

<li>
to extract the bit to the left of it, first divide the input integer by
10 {<i>use /</i>}, then the bit value will be the remainder {<i>again use
the </i><b>%</b><i> operator</i>}</li>

<li>
repeat until you have a value for all eight bits.</li>
</ol>

<li>
<u>Print </u>the eight bits, in order, all on one line {<i>use <b>setw(1)</b>
for each.&nbsp; This requires the inclusion of the <b>iomanip</b> library</i>.}</li>

<li>
<u>Declare all variables</u>.</li>

<li>
At this point, compile and run your program to ensure that it is working
correctly before we move on to the next stage.&nbsp; The written bits must
be in the <u>same order</u> as the input bits.&nbsp; Use several test numbers.</li>

<li>
Use the algorithm on page 882 of Appendix D-2 of our C++ textbook to convert
the binary number to decimal.</li>

<ol>
<li>
&nbsp;Use a variable to represent the successive powers of two and update
it with the "<b>*=</b>"&nbsp;compound assignment operator.</li>

<li>
Update the running sum of powers of two (corresponding to the non-zero
bits) in another variable with the "<b>+=</b>" compound assignment operator.</li>

<li>
Perform the above for all eight bits.</li>
</ol>

<li>
Print the decimal value of the binary number on its own line which also
describes to the user what the number is.</li>

<li>
<u>Declare all variables</u></li>

<li>
Compile and run.&nbsp; make sure the program is working correctly.&nbsp;
Use several test numbers.</li>

<li>
When correct, use <b>script</b> to generate a printout of the source followed
by a demonstration of the execution of the program to submit.</li>
    <ol>
	<li>
	Use the following data to demonstrate: [11111111], [1010101], [1010].
    </ol>
