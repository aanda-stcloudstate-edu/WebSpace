<h2> Introduction:</h2>
This lab provides experience with two-dimensional <b><i>ragged</i></b> arrays.
<h2> Lab Assignment:</h2>

<h4> Problem Motivation and Definition:</h4>

This lab is intended to provide experience with initializing, printing, and
indexing of two-dimensional <b><i>ragged</i></b> arrays as well as experience
with <u>pointers</u> and <u>dynamic memory</u> which are required for the
implementation of ragged arrays.<p>

We want to modify the last lab's program which initialized and printed a
two-dimensional array.  The array was filled with Pascal's triangle.<p>
We will now create the two-dimensional array dynamically as as a ragged array.
The problem is defined in our text as <tt>problem 9-71</tt>.

<h4> Solution Specification:</h4>
<ol>
<ol>
<li> Create a new directory, <i>lab12</i>, and move to it.</li>

<li>
Solve Problem 9-71 from page 484 of our C++ text.
</li>

<ol>

<li>
Read in a size for the triangle.
</li>

<li>
Initialize a ragged array of the correct dimensions.<p>
(<i> See <b>Figure 9-41</b> on p. 461 and <b>Programs</b> <b>9-15</b> through
    <b>9-18</b> on pages 466-468.</i>)
</li>

<li>
<b>Note:</b> [<i>design decision</i>] You have the option of building the array rows dynamically,
interleaving the dynamic creation of a row with the population of its elements.
</li>

</ol>

<li>
Test with sizes = {1, 3, 12, 20}
</li>

<li>
When correct, generate a printout of the source, and demonstrate, via
typescript, the source and the running of the program for the test data.<br>
<b>Note:</b> so that the full width of the size 20 triangle may be displayed,
printout using the following command rather than lpr:<br>
<tt>enscript --landscape <i>filename</i></tt>
</li>

</ol>
