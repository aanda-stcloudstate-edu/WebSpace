The following programs were compiled and tested using CodeWarrior IDE 
version 5. 

The programs in this chapter run without modification as presented
in the text with the exception of p09-09 AND p08-11, which require
 a driver program.

p09-01.cpp Demonstrate use of pointers
p09-02.cpp Fun with pointers
p09-03.cpp Add two numbers using pointers
p09-04.cpp Using one pointer for many variables
p09-05.cpp Using one variable with many pointers
p09-06.cpp Using pointers to pointers
p09-07.cpp Demonstrate size of pointers
p09-08.cpp Demonstrate Writing Pointer Values
p09-09.cpp Convert seconds to hours, minutes, and seconds
p09-10.cpp Quadratic roots
p09-11.cpp Pointers and the binary search
p09-12.cpp Multiply array elements by two
p09-13.cpp Dynamic allocation of two dimensional array
p09-14.cpp Selection sort revisited

p09-15ff.cpp Dynamic arrays: main
	p09-16 (In P09-15) Dynamic arrays: build table
	p09-17 (In P09-15) Dynamic arrays: fill table
	p09-18 (In P09-15) Dynamic arrays: process table
	p09-19 (In P09-15) Dynamic arrays: find row minimum
	p09-20 (In P09-15) Dynamic arrays: find row maximum
	p09-21 (In P09-15) Dynamic arrays: find row average
	p09-22 (In P09-15) Dynamic arrays: find smaller
	p09-23 (In P09-15) Dynamic arrays: find larger
