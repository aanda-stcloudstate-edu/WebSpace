The following programs were compiled and tested using CodeWarrior IDE 
version 4.2.6.

Note that some of the code fragments in this chapter were modified to 
create an executable program.

Some of the programs in this chapter require modification as indicated 
below. If no modifications are indicated, the programs run as presented 
in the text. 

We have provided input files on this disk. Depending on your operating
system and hardware, these file may not work. We have therefore indicated 
the suggested data for the files below.
