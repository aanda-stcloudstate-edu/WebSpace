CSCI 201 [1,3] Fall 2002

Programming Assignment 2

Due Tuesday, Oct 15, 2002

Objective:

This assignment is designed to provide you with problem solving experience
involving writing a program which includes a wide variety of expressions
and input & output.  No conditionals, loops or user defined data structures
are necessary to solve this problem.

Problem:

Design a program which converts from decimal to binary, octal, and
hexadecimal.

Specifications:

The program requests from the user an unsigned integer ranging between
zero and 255 inclusive.  The interactive output will conform to the
following example:

____________________________________________________________________________
    CSCI 201 [<sect. # here>]
    Programmer: <your name here>
    Program 2 output

    Enter an integer between 0 and 255 (inclusive)

    254

    The decimal integer [ 254 ] is represented by
       *) the eight digit binary value [ 11111110 ],
       *) the octal value [ 376 ],
       *) and the hexadecimal value [ fe ].
____________________________________________________________________________

* Use compound assignment expressions whenever possible.

* Use the Unix command [ script -a script_file_name] to generate a copy of
  your I/O from running your program.  (refer to: [man script] for usage
  instructions)

* Use the algorithm on pages 769-770 to convert decimal to binary.

* Hint: you don't need to use an algorithm to generate the octal and hex
        output values.  The solution is in [Section 2-8]

* Maximize the readability of your program.  Follow the guidelines in
  [Appendix H] unless you can apply a more readable alternative in a
  particular context in your program.

    * Use comments to identify yourself, the date, the course and section, and
      the purpose of the program -- all at the top of your program.
      
    * Use descriptive comments and identifiers throughout your code.

SUBMIT:

* A listing of your source.

* A copy {using the Unix [script] command} of your programs output for the
  following data values: 0, 17, 85, 170, 255.
