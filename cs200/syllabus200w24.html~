CONTENT DELIVERY AND ACCESSIBILITY:
The delivery method is <b>"Hyflex"</b>

Hyflex Content Delivery and Accessibility:
I plan to teach Hyflex using a blend of synchronous and asynchronous delivery via Zoom and D2L,
where it should make no effective and essential difference whether at any time you are F2F or remote.
I intend to record all lectures.  And, most materials will be available through D2L.
Student submissions of quizzes, assignments, notes, etc. will be via D2L.
This plan should maximize flexibility for both you and me to adapt to whatever factors change progressively
or suddenly for either you or me.
You will never be expected to be F2F in our classroom.
My default mode of presentation is synchronous.
Your default Zoom mode of access should be with your camera on, and your mute must be on (unless commenting or asking a question).
If you are connecting synchronously through Zoom, you are encouraged to contribute at any time by unmuting, or by Zoom text.
Here's the SCSU definition of Hyflex (from the Provost's Fall 2021 Instructional Resource and Support Guide):
    Hyflex Course - Course activity is both online and in-person, at the same time, offering students flexibility with their learning.
    In a hyflex course, all learning activities are delivered via asynchronous online, synchronous online, and in-person.
    With faculty consultation, a student may choose which mode of learning works best for their circumstance.
    Although there are asynchronous learning activities, the course is not self-paced.
    Meetings are online (both synchronous (scheduled) and asynchronous) and in-person.
    Exams are typically in-person and synchronous online (not asynchronous).
    In-person and synchronous meeting/exam dates and times are often scheduled in ISRS (registration system) and in the syllabus.

    Introduction to Boolean functions and circuits. Social considerations. Lab. 3 Cr.

COURSE SPECIFICS:
    This course uses the markup language HTML and the scripting programming
    language JavaScript in conjunction with appropriate mathematical concepts
    to introduce the fundamentals of computer science, problem-solving

    In particular, this course presents editing and running programs;
    documentation and testing; control structures; input and output;
    Boolean functions and circuits.

LEARNING OUTCOMES:
    * Students will develop and implement solutions to problems design and implement programs to solve problems using top-down and modular design techniques
    * Students will apply appropriate standard algorithm, functions and control structures to the solutions to problems
    * Students will create and organize programs and data files using appropriate software tools
    * Students will test and document code
    * Students will build and test simple Boolean circuits using logic gates, Boolean functions, and truth tables
    * Students will recognize the ethical and social issues connected to computing with examples from the history of computing

PREREQUISITES:
    (This course assumes no prior programming experience)
    Complete ANY of the following Courses:
	MATH072 - Intermediate Algebra
	OR MATH112 - College Algebra
	OR MATH115 - Precalculus

CLOSED LABS:
    We will spend time working on lab assignments on Friday every week.
    The instructor and lab assistants will be available to assist you.
    We encourage you to work in pairs on the lab assignments.
    Lab assignments are due as specified in the D2L Calendar.

ASSIGNMENTS:
    In addition to the projects assigned during the closed labs, you will
    also be expected to complete programming projects on your own outside
    of class time.
    Programs are due as specified in the D2L Calendar.
    Late work may be marked down or not accepted.

ACADEMIC HONESTY:
    You are expected to do your own homework.  If you copy someone else's
    work or allow someone else to copy your work, you are being academically
    dishonest and will be subject to severe disciplinary action which may
    include any or all of: no credit for the work in question, a failing grade
    for the course, notification to the university that you have violated your
    Code of Conduct.  Use of recording devices during exams is prohibited.
    If you must quote or paraphrase another source, citation is essential,
    otherwise plagiarism has been committed.  You are expected to be familiar
    with your rights and obligations as outlined in the &quot;Code of Conduct&quot;
    [<a href="http://www.stcloudstate.edu/studenthandbook/code/default.asp]">http://www.stcloudstate.edu/studenthandbook/code/default.asp]</a>

STUDYING IN GROUPS:
    I encourage you to study with someone else in the class, but when you
    prepare the final documents to turn in be sure that it is your own words,
    code, and sentences, and that you understand what you are submitting.
    If you represent someone else’s work as your own or allow someone else to
    turn your work in as theirs you will be turned in for cheating and you will
    will have earned a grade of F.


DECORUM: Conduct yourself so as not to distract others. In particular
    * Turn off all cell phones, watch alarms, and similar devices.
    * Do not engage in distracting activities like reading a newspaper
      or sleeping. (some of you snore...)
    * Arrive for class on time, and be ready to begin.
      If you must be late, be quiet as you enter.
    * If you are early, sit toward the middle of a row.
    * Do not start packing up before class ends.

ATTENDANCE:
    You are responsible for knowing what happens at each class meeting.
    If you are having trouble in class please see me in my office.
    (If you don't tell me you're having troubles how do you expect me to know?)
    If you can't come during my office hours, make an appointment for
    another time.


QUIZZES:
    There will be a sequence of quizzes of assigned reading prior to the
    coverage of most chapters we'll cover.

EXAMS:
    There will be a small set of intermediate exams and a comprehensive
    final exam.
    Exams will be based on the notes; that is, on the presentations in class
    as well as on the content in the assigned readings.
    Calculators will be neither necessary nor allowed.
    Make-up exams will be given in only in extreme (or university
    sanctioned) circumstances and only with prior notice.

GRADING:
        Your grade will be determined by the contributions of your scores
        on assignments,  quizzes, intermediate and final exams.
        Makeup of tests, quizzes, and exams are by prior arrangement only.

APPROXIMATE WEIGHTING FOR GRADING:
        Labs:                   20%
        Assignments             20%
        Hour Exams              25%
        Final Exam              35%

FINAL EXAM: Wednesday, May 1, 9:55 AM - 12:10 AM
