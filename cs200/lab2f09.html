    <dt><b>Task 1 - Create a Web page</b><br>
    <dd>Add an <tt>&lt;html&gt;</tt> tag pair; <br>
    then add <tt>&lt;head&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt> tag pairs inside;<br>
    then add a <tt>&lt;title&gt;</tt> that reads <tt>Lab 2 (your name here)</tt>;
    then add some text about yourself into the <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt> region.
        
    <dt><b>Task 2 - Text spacing</b><br>
    <dd>Add additional paragraphs to your Web page. You can write about yourself or describe your hobbies. Next, list some favorite books or movies.<br>
        Use <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;br&gt;</tt>, and <tt>&amp;nbsp;</tt> appropriately to make your page readable and attractive.

    <dt><b>Task 3 - Headings and alignment</b><br>
    <dd>Divide your home page into sections.  Use a large heading to list your name so that it is centered at the top of the page, followed by a horizontal line. For each subsequent text section,
    use a smaller heading.  At least one section of your page should contain multiple paragraphs.

    <dt><b>Task 4 - Font formatting</b><br>
    <dd>Augment your home page by coloring some of the text and using font formatting where appropriate.
    For example, if you listed favorite books or movies, you could italicize or underline their titles.

    <dt><b>Task 5 - Hyperlinks</b><br>
    <dd>Add a section to your home page containing at least five hyperlinks to sites that you consider useful and/or interesting.
    To ensure that these hyperlinks work correctly, you should click each one and then view the linked page in your browser.
    For example, if you listed favorite books or movies, you could italicize or underline their titles.

    <dt><b>Task 6 - Images</b><br>
    <dd>Look around the Web, and choose a public-domain image that you would like to include on your web page.
    You must be careful not to violate copyrights or otherwise infringe upon the rights of the owner unless explicitly stated otherwise, you should assume that any image on the Web is private property.
    Once located, copy the image to your LAB1 directory and incorporate the local image into your home page.
    Be sure to include alternate text for your image via the ALT attribute.
</dl>

When finished (after you’ve proofread your Web page), submit your file to the appropriate D2L dropbox.
