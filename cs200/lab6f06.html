<h2>Introduction:</h2>
This lab exercises the ability to Perform I/O via
<u>ONCHANGE</u> <i>text box</i>es in the context of <i><u>event driven</u> programming</i>.
We are also utilizing the two division operators to implement conversion between binary and decimal in both directions.
<h2>Lab Assignment:</h2>

Using the <tt>copybox.html</tt> [Web page / file] from the author's
<a href="http://www.prenhall.com/reed/chapters.html">resource page</a>,
Use the <u>ONCHANGE</u> attribute to convert the binary number in one box to the decimal in the other, and vice versa.<br>
The binary number will have to be stored as a decimal whose digits are constrained to the values of zero and one.  E.g. binary five [ 101 ] is stored as decimal one hundred one.<br>
Label the text boxes appropriately.<br>
Assume that the data is constrained to one byte of storage so that the maximum value
is a positive decimal integer between zero and 255 inclusive, and the maximum binary is 11111111.<br>

Ensure that in your code identifiers (e.g. variable and function names) are labeled appropriately.

<p>

For this exercise:
<ol>
    <li>The Web page file name should indicate the lab number.</li>
    <li>change the <u><tt>&lt;TITLE&gt;</tt></u> to consist of:</li>
    <ol>
	<li>Your name</li>
	<li>The lab number</li>
    </ol>
</ol>

When finished:
<ul>
    <li>Submit your exercise solution Web page to the dropbox.</li>
    <li>Indicate in the dropbox comment field who your lab partner was for this lab.</li>
