                * An Introduction to the Personal Software Process
                    by Watts Humphrey, Addison Wesley, 1997.

COURSE CATALOG DESCRIPTION:
    Problem-solving strategies, top-down design, and computer algorithms.
    Files and editing. Compiling and running programs. Documentation and
    testing. Control structures, input and output, and functions. Boolean
    functions and circuits. Time management in the software process. Social
    considerations. Lab.

COURSE SPECIFICS:
    This course uses the markup language HTML and the scripting programming
    language JavaScript in conjunction with appropriate mathematical concepts
    to introduce the fundamentals of computer science, problem-solving
    strategies, top-down design, and computer algorithms. In particular, this
    course presents editing, compiling and running programs; documentation and
    testing; control structures; input and output; Boolean functions and
    circuits; time management in the software process and social considerations.

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:
    * Students will manage and edit files, design and implement algorithms,
        and compile and run programs.
    * Students will apply fundamental programming control structures: loops,
        branching, and functions.
    * Students will manipulate, build, and test simple Boolean circuits.
    * Students will examine the social context of computing and its
        consequences.

PREREQUISITES:
    MATH 196 or Coreq.: MATH 112 or test out of MATH 112 via math placement
    exam.

CLOSED LABS:
    We will spend time in the lab on Tuesday every week.  These labs cannot
    be made up.  Attendance will be taken. You are expected to get there on
    time and stay the entire time.

ASSIGNMENTS:
    In addition to the projects assigned during the closed labs, you will
    also be expected to complete programming projects on your own outside
    of class time.  The programs are due at the beginning of class on the
    due date.  No allowance will be made for computer down time, so plan
    ahead.  Late work may be marked down or not accepted.

ACADEMIC HONESTY:
    You are expected to do your own homework.  If you copy someone else's
    work or allow someone else to copy your work, you are being academically
    dishonest and will be subject to severe disciplinary action which may
    include any or all of: no credit for the work in question, a failing grade
    for the course, notification to the university that you have violated your
    Code of Conduct.  Use of recording devices during exams is prohibited.
    If you must quote or paraphrase another source, citation is essential,
    otherwise plagiarism has been committed.  You are expected to be familiar
    with your rights and obligations as outlined in the &quot;Code of Conduct&quot;

DECORUM: Conduct yourself so as not to distract others. In particular
    * Turn off all cell phones, watch alarms, and similar devices.
    * Do not engage in distracting activities like reading a newspaper
      or sleeping. (some of you snore...)
    * Arrive for class on time, and be ready to begin.
      If you must be late, be quiet.
    * If you are early, sit toward the middle of a row.
    * Do not start packing up before class ends.

ATTENDANCE:
    You are responsible for knowing what happens at each class meeting.

QUIZZES:
    There will be a sequence of quizzes of assigned reading prior to the
    coverage of a chapter.

EXAMS:
    There will be a small set of intermediate exams and a comprehensive
    final exam.
    Exams will be based on the notes; that is, on the presentations in class
    as well as on the content in the assigned readings.
    Calculators will be neither necessary nor allowed.
    Make-up exams will be given in only in extreme (or university
    sanctioned) circumstances and only with prior notice.

GRADING:
        Your grade will be determined by the contributions of your scores
        on assignments,  quizzes, intermediate and final exams.
        Makeup of tests, quizzes, and exams are by prior arrangement only.

APPROXIMATE WEIGHTING FOR GRADING:
        Quizzes                 10%
        Labs:                   10%
        Assignments             20%
        Hour Exams              30%
        Final Exam              30%
