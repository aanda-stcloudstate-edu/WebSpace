	<h2>Introduction:</h2>
	This lab exercises the ability to:
	<ul>
	    <li><u>Write</u>, <u>run</u>, and <u>test</u> an <b>assembly language</b> program for Reed's
	    <a href="http://balance3e.com/Ch14/machine.html">Complete Knob&amp;Switch Computer Simulator</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Lab Assignment:</h2>

	<ol>
	    <li> Create a new folder, <b><tt>Lab10</tt></b>, in your <b><tt>labs</tt></b> folder.</li>
	    <li> Move into your <b><tt>Lab10</tt></b> folder</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	For the following two Exercises, before programming the Simulator, type (or write down) your assembly program,
	then step through it.<br>
	(<b>Hint:</b> at first, use variables for your data memory addresses, then when your code passes your step-through,
	and you know the address of the halt statement, then replace the variables with the appropriate addresses)
	<p>
	<ol>
	    <li> <u>Exercise 14.13</u> with the following modification
	    <ul>
		<li>use the memory location immediately following the <tt>HALT</tt> instruction as your (<i>input</i>) operand (the value to be multiplied by four.
		<li>use the memory location immediately following the input operand as your (<i>output</i> result) product destination.
		<li>use only one register.
	    </ul>
	    <li>Create a program to perform the <u>multiplication</u> operation by
		computing the product of the <i>positive</i> integers in the first two memory locations follwing the <tt>HALT</tt> command.
		Store the resulting product in the third memory location following the <tt>HALT</tt> instruction.<br>
		[<i>HINT</i>: create a loop for which every iteration adds one operand to a running sum<br>
		(<i>which will represent the product at the end</i>) while decrementing the other operand.<br>
		Stop the loop, then store the (resulting) product when the decremented value is zero.<br>
		(consider using a <b>Branching Instruction</b> from the <a href="http://balance3e.com/Ch14/instructions.html">K & S Model 2 - Assembly & Machine Language Instruction Set</a>, such as the <tt>BZERO</tt> instruction, to implement loops)]
	    <li><b>Extra Credit</b>: Raise the positive value in the first of two memory locations follwing the
		<tt>HALT</tt> instruction to the power of the positive value in the second memory location and store
		the result in the third memory location.
</ol>
	</ol>
	<p>
	When each simulation performs correctly, submit <u>screenshots</u> of the simulator,
	<i>before</i> and <i>after</i> each assembly language program runs on the simulator,
	to the Lab10 D2L dropbox.
