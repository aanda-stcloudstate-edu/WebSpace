<h2>Introduction:</h2>
This lab exercises the ability to:
<ul>
    <li>Write, run, and test an assembly language program for Reed's Knob &amp; Switch Stored Program Computer Simulator.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lab Assignment:</h2>

Perform the following Exercise in Reed:
<ol>
    <li> <u>Exercise 14.13</u> with the following modification
    <ul>
	<li>use the memory location immediately following the <tt>HALT</tt> instruction as your (input) operand.
	<li>use the memory location immediately following the input operand as your (output result) product destination.
    </ul>
    <li> <b>extra credit:</b> Multiply together the positive integers in the first two memory locations follwing the <tt>HALT</tt> 
    command.  Store the (result) product in the third memory loacation following the <tt>HALT</tt> instruction.<br>
    [<i>hint</i>: create a loop which every iteration adds one operand to a running sum (<i>which will represent the product at the end</i>) while decrementing the other operand.
    Stop the loop and store the (result) product when the decremented value is zero.]
</ol>
    <p>
    When correct, submit <u>screenshots</u> of the simulator before and after the run to the appropriate D2L dropbox.
