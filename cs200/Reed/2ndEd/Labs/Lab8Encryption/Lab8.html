<P> In Chapter 15, you were introduced to JavaScript strings as objects, encapsulating 
both properties (e.g., <TT>length</TT>) and operations (e.g., <TT>toUpperCase</TT>, 
<TT>charAt</TT>).  In this lab, you will apply many of these string operations to the 
task of encoding and decoding messages.  In addition, you will learn about the history 
of encryption: the use of codes and ciphers to protect secret messages.

<H3> Substitution Ciphers</H3>

<P> The use of codes (or <I>ciphers</I>) as a means of hiding the meaning of messages 
traces its roots to ancient history.  The first documented use of codes was by Hebrew 
scribes in approximately 500 - 600 B.C.  The <I>Atbash cipher</I> specified that each 
letter in a message would be encoded using the corresponding letter in the alphabet 
reversed.  For example, 'A' would be encoded as 'Z', 'B' would be encoded as 'Y', 'C' 
would be encoded as 'X', and so on.  The first known military use of codes was by 
Julius Caesar in 50 - 60 B.C.  The <I>Caesar cipher</I> specified that each letter in 
the alphabet would be encoded using the letter three later in the alphabet.  For 
example, 'A' would be encoded as 'D', 'B' would be encoded as 'E', 'C' would be encoded 
as 'F', and so on.  The code wraps around at the end of the alphabet, so 'X', 'Y' and 
'Z' would be encoded as 'A', 'B', and 'C', respectively.   </P>

<P> Both the Atbash and Caesar ciphers are examples of <I>substitution ciphers,</I> 
codes in which one letter of the alphabet is substituted for another.  A substitution 
cipher can be described succinctly by specifying its key, i.e., the sequence of letters 
to which the alphabet is mapped.   For example, the keys for the Atbash  and Caesar 
ciphers are listed below.  To encode a specific letter using one of these ciphers, 
simply find the corresponding letter in the key below it. 

<XMP>

    Atbash cipher:                        Caesar cipher:
        ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ            ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
        | | | | | | | | | | | | |             | | | | | | | | | | | | |
        v v v v v v v v v v v v v             v v v v v v v v v v v v v
        ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA            DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC
        
</XMP>

For example, the Atbash cipher would encode the word "CODE" as "XLWV", whereas the 
Caesar cipher would encode it as "FRGH".  Although both of these ciphers were effective 
at their time (when very few people could read at all), their simple patterns of 
encoding letters seem pretty obvious today. In principle, though, a substitution cipher 
can specify any mapping from letters to letters.  For example:

<XMP>


    Mystery cipher:                
        ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 
        | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
        v v v v v v v v v v v v v  
        QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM   
        
</XMP>

Substitution ciphers have several attractive features.  For one, they are relatively 
simple to understand and use.  They are also reasonably effective.  There are 26! (or 
roughly <FONT SIZE=-1>4 x 10<SUP>26</SUP></FONT>) different arrangements of the 26 
letters in the alphabet.  Since each of these arrangements may be used as a key for a 
substitution cipher, there are 26! different codes that can be used.  By selecting one 
of these keys, the corresponding cipher can be used to encode messages.  As long as the 
recipient of the message has that same key, the message can be easily decoded.  Without 
the key, however, decoding a message can be extremely difficult.  </P>

<H3> Encoding Messages</H3>

<P> As the previous section showed, encoding messages using a substitution cipher is 
relatively straightforward.  The following steps must take place:

<PRE>
    for as many letters as there are in the message
        get the next character in the message
        find its position in the <U>alphabet</U>
        find the corresponding letter in the <U>key</U>
        use that letter to encode the letter in the message
</PRE>

<P>These steps can be encoded in JavaScript as a function which takes the key and a 
message as inputs and returns the encoded message.  In the HTML document below, the 
<TT>Encode</TT> 
function performs this encoding using the variable <TT>coded</TT> to accumulate the 
coded message.  The variable is initially assigned to be the empty string, and as each 
letter in the message is processed, the appropriate code letter is concatenated onto 
the end of <TT>coded</TT>.  After traversing the entire message, <TT>coded</TT> will 
contain the complete encoded version of the message.

Add an ONCHANGE attribute to the text area containing the message to be encoded.  When 
the user enters a message into this text area, all lower-case letters in the message 
should automatically be made upper-case.  Similarly, add an ONCHANGE attribute to the 
key text box so that the letters in the key are similarly guaranteed to be upper-case.

<H3> Decoding Messages</H3>

<P> Given an encoded message and the key by which it was encoded, decoding a message is 
a straightforward process.  The steps in the encoding must simply be performed in 
reverse.  That is, each coded letter must be mapped back into the corresponding letter 
of the alphabet.  Consider the Atbash cipher, for example:   

<XMP>
    Atbash cipher:                  
        ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ   
        | | | | | | | | | | | | |     (mapping to encode)
        v v v v v v v v v v v v v  
        ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA 
        | | | | | | | | | | | | |     (reverse mapping to decode)
        v v v v v v v v v v v v v   
        ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ  
</XMP>

Since the letter 'A' is encoded as 'Z', the letter 'Z' is decoded by performing the 
reverse mapping back to 'A'.  For each letter in a coded message, this reverse mapping 
can be made to recover the original letter.  The steps involved in decoding an encoded 
message can be described as follows:

<PRE>
    for as many letters as there are in the encoded message
        get the next character in the encoded message
        find its position in the <U>key</U>
        find the corresponding letter in the <U>alphabet</U>
        use that letter to decode the letter in the encoded message
</PRE>

<I>Note the similarities between the steps in encoding and decoding messages!</I>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><FONT COLOR="red">EXERCISE 4:</FONT></B> &nbsp;&nbsp;
Add a function called <TT>Decode</TT> to your <TT>cipher.html</TT> page.  This function 
should be similar to the <TT>Encode</TT> function given to you, only it should decode 
instead of encode messages.  It should take two inputs, representing the encoded 
message and the substitution key, and should return the decoded version of that 
message.  Add another button to the Web page labeled "<TT>Decode <==</TT>", immediately 
below the "<TT>Encode ==></TT>" button.  When the user clicks on that button, the 
contents of the text area on the right should be decoded, and the corresponding message 
should be written in the text area on the left.  

<P>Test your <TT>Decode</TT> function thoroughly.  List test values below that you used 
to convince yourself that decodings are being performed correctly.</P>

<H3> Rotating Ciphers</H3>

<P> In practice, substitution ciphers can often be broken (decoded without the key) 
using insight and computational power.  As a good example of this, you may be familiar 
with Crypto-quotes puzzles that appear in many newspapers.  These puzzles use a 
substitution cipher to encode a quotation, and the challenge is to decode the 
quotation.  This can be done by analyzing the patterns of words and the frequency of 
letters in the quotation.  For example, if the same three-letter sequence appears 
numerous times in the coded quotation, you might work under the assumption that it 
represents the common word "the".  </P>

<P> The weakness of substitution ciphers is that they always map the
same letter of the alphabet to the same key letter.  Thus, it is possible to look at
the coded message and look for patterns.  An interesting variation on
substitution ciphers was adopted by Nazi Germany during World War II.
The Germans used a machine called an Enigma for encoding all military
messages.  The Enigma machine utilized a series of interconnected
rotors to encode letters.  In essence, the rotors defined a
substitution cipher, mapping one letter to another.  What made the
Enigma machine so effective, however, was that the rotors were rotated
after each letter was encoded, essentially changing the substitution
cipher after every letter!  This added wrinkle made the Enigma codes
virtually impossible to break (until electronic computers were
built). </P>

<P> This same effect can be obtained in a simple substitution cipher
by rotating the key after each letter is encoded (ignoring
non-letters).  For example, suppose you are using the Atbash cipher to
encode "AAA".  After mapping 'A' to 'Z', the key
"<TT>ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA</TT>" would be rotated (say one letter
to the left) to obtain "<TT>YXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBAZ</TT>".  Thus,
the second 'A' would be mapped to 'Y'.  Similarly, another rotation of
the key would cause the third 'A' to be mapped to 'X'.  Using a
rotating key, each occurrence of a letter in the message is mapped to
a different letter, and so pattern analysis is more difficult.  </P>


<P><BR></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><FONT COLOR="red">EXERCISE 5:</FONT></B> &nbsp;&nbsp;
In Chapter 15, you defined a function named 
<TT>RotateLeft</TT> that took a string as input and rotated the characters in that 
string one position to the left (wrapping the first character back around to the end).  
Add the <TT>RotateLeft</TT> function to your <TT>cipher.html</TT> page and call it in 
both <TT>Encode</TT> and <TT>Decode</TT> to rotate the key after each letter is 
encoded/decoded. <I>Note:</I> you should not rotate the key unless a letter is actually 
encoded using the key.  </P>

<P><BR></P>

<P> Once you have written your code, you should test it thoroughly.  List test values 
below that you used to convince yourself that encodings/decodings are being performed 
correctly.
