<P> You are now familiar with all of the basic programming constructs in JavaScript: 
variables, functions, conditionals, and loops. Using these constructs and the 
experience you have gained in solving relatively small problems, you are ready to begin 
designing
and implementing solutions to more complex problems. In this lab, you will work in 
small groups to design a program for playing an interactive game, and then implement 
the design independently.  To assist you in the design process, you will follow an 
iterative refinement approach to designing the program.

<H3> Binary reduction guessing game </H3>

<P>  For this lab, you are to design and implement a page for playing a guessing game 
with the user.  The game begins by asking the user to think of a number in some range, 
such as 1 to 100.  Your program should then repeatedly guess numbers until it gets the 
user's number.  After each guess, the program will receive feedback from the user as to 
whether the guess was correct, too high, or too low.  The number of guesses required to 
get the user's number should be displayed at the end.   Your page should appear as 
follows, with text boxes that allow the user to specify the range of numbers and a 
button for starting the game:

<P>When the user clicks on the button, they should be shown the program's initial 
guess, and prompted to see whether that guess is correct, too high, or too low.  The 
program should continue generating guesses and prompting for responses until it finally 
guesses the user's number.


<P> One way to think of the game from the program's perspective is to focus on the 
range in which the user's number must lie.  At the beginning of the game, the user's 
number could be anywhere in the initial range, say 1 to 100.  By making a guess, such 
as 50, the computer is able to reduce the range in which the user's number can lie.  
For example, if 50 was too low, then the number must lie in the range 51 to 100.  
Likewise, if 50 was too high, then the number must lie in the range 1 to 49.  
Subsequent guesses can reduce the range even further, repeating the process until the 
program eventually hones in on and guesses the number.   Since the program should try 
to guess the user's number <I>in the fewest number of guesses,</I> it should always 
guess the midpoint of the possible range of numbers in order to divide the possible 
range in half.  Because of the halving effect, this strategy is known as <I>binary 
reduction.</I>. </P>

<H3> Iterative refinement </H3>

<P>Before you begin designing and implementing a program for playing the binary 
reduction guessing game, it is worthwhile to take a moment and think about program 
design.  Designing a program from scratch is not always a simple task.  Without 
forethought and planning, it is easy to become overwhelmed in complexity and lose focus 
when writing code.  In fact, Henry Ledgard once remarked:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>The sooner you start coding your program, the longer it's going to take.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>A common, systematic approach to designing programs is known as <I>iterative 
refinement</I>. The basic idea is to start with a general description of a solution to 
the given problem, and then incrementally add more and more detail until the final 
program is derived.  The main advantage of an incremental approach is that it helps to 
manage complexity. At the start, you can abstract away some of the details in order to 
describe a general outline to the solution. Then, you can add details slowly, a little 
bit at a time, so that no single step in the design process is overwhelmingly complex. 
In this way, a series of small refinements to a general outline can lead to the 
solution of a complex problem.

<B><FONT COLOR="red">EXERCISE 1:</FONT></B> &nbsp;&nbsp;
Form a group of 2 or 3 students and discuss a general outline for the binary guessing 
game program.  Your outline should be relatively high-level, identifying the major 
tasks involved in playing this game and their relative order.  You should NOT be 
thinking about HTML or JavaScript code at this point -- simply describe the tasks in 
English.  

<P>Once your group has agreed on a general outline, you should write it below <I>in 
your own words.</I>  </P>

<B><FONT COLOR="red">EXERCISE 2:</FONT></B> &nbsp;&nbsp;
Once you have written your own version of the solution outline, return to your group 
and take the next step of identifying the major programming constructs that will go 
into your program.  That is, specify which control statements (e.g., if, if-else, 
while) will be needed for which tasks, any counters that will be used, and how input 
and output will be accomplished.  Once your group has agreed on a list of control 
statements and constructs, you should write it below <I>in your own words.</I>   </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><FONT COLOR="red">EXERCISE 3:</FONT></B> &nbsp;&nbsp;
Again, return to your group and design the overall layout of the program.  That is, 
write a code framework that shows how the control statements will fit together and what 
the particular tasks to be completed are.  For example, if your solution involves an if 
statement inside a while loop, write these constructs in their relative positions, with 
English pseudo-code to fill in the gaps in the code.  Once your group has agreed on a 
layout, you should write it below <I>in your own words.</I>  </P>

Finally, complete the definition of your program by filling in the missing details.  
This work should be done by you <I>independently.</I>  You may confer with members of 
your group to clarify aspects of the layout or to adjust the design if warranted, but 
the actual coding of the details should be performed <I>by you alone.</I> </P>

<P>Save your code in a document named <TT>game.html</TT>.

Once you have completed your code, test it thoroughly.  </P>

<P> If the initial range is 1 to 10, what is the minimum number of guesses needed  to 
guess the user's number?  What is the maximum number needed?  Explain and give examples 
which support your claims.  </P>

<P> If the initial range is 1 to 20, what is the minimum number of guesses needed  to 
guess the user's number?  What is the maximum number needed?  Explain and give examples

<P> If the initial range is 1 to 40, what is the minimum number of guesses needed  to 
guess the user's number?  What is the maximum number needed?  Explain and give examples

<P> If the initial range is 50 to 89, what is the minimum number of guesses needed  to

<P><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></P>

<P> If the initial range contains 1000 numbers, it turns out that the maximum number of 
guesses needed to guess the user's number is 10.  What would be the maximum number of 
guesses needed to guess the number if the initial range contained 2000 numbers?  10,000 
numbers?  Explain your reasoning.</P>

<B><FONT COLOR="red">EXERCISE 6:</FONT></B> &nbsp;&nbsp;
What happens in the game if the user cheats, i.e., changes their number during the 
game?  For example, suppose that the user thinks of a number between 1 and 100, say 20.  
The program guesses 50, which is too high, so it next guesses 25.  If the user then 
changes their number to 79, will your program find the new number?  Why or why not? 
</P>

<P> For extra credit, modify your program so that it recognizes when the user has 
cheated and admonishes them accordingly. </P>
