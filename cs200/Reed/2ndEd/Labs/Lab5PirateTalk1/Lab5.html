<p>In 1995, John Baur and Mark Summers invented a new holiday, 
International Talk Like a Pirate Day.  As they proposed it, on every September 19th, 
people all around the world would be united in common purpose by talking like a
pirate (with lots of "Arrrrs" and "Ahoys" and the like).  Since then, International
Talk Like a Pirate Day has received widespread publicity, especially since 
columnist Dave Barry began lobbying for the holiday.  At the official Talk Like a 
Pirate Day Web site, <a 
href="http://www.talklikeapirate.com">www.talklikeapirate.com</a>,
you can read about the history of the holiday, order official merchandise, and even
experiment with a simple Web page that translates simple English phrases into pirate 
talk.

<p>The following Web page is a framework for an alternative English-to-Pirate
translator.  As is, it contains two buttons, labeled "hello" and "stranger", 
and a text area.  When the user clicks on a button, the corresponding Pirate word 
or phrase is added to the text area.  For example, if the user were to click on 
the "hello" button, the word "ahoy" will appear in the text area.  If she then clicks
on the "stranger" button, then "scurvy dog" is added to the text area, resulting in the 
phrase
"ahoy scurvy dog."

Cut-and-paste this HTML text into a Web page named <tt>pirate1.html</tt> and 
verify that it behaves as described.

<p>As the page is currently written, multiple translations are awkward.  If you 
finish translating one phrase and want to begin a new one, simply refreshing the page 
does not suffice to clear the text area.  Instead, you must click the mouse in 
the browser's Address box and hit enter  to reload the page and 
reset the text area.  To make repeated translations easier, add a button directly 
below the text area labeled "Clear".  When the user clicks on this button, a function 
should be 
called to clear the 
text 
area (i.e., set its contents to be the empty string).

Extend <tt>pirate1.html</tt> by adding new words and phrases.  For each new word or 
phrase, you will need to add a button with the appropriate label and translated
pirate phrase.  At a minimum, you must add the new words and phrases below.
However, feel free to add a larger vocabulary 
(see <a href="http://www.talklikeapirate.com">www.talklikeapirate.com</a> for ideas).

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr><th><th align=left><u>English word/phrase</u></th><th>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<th 
align=left><u>Pirate 
equivalent</u></th>
<tr><td>Greetings: &nbsp;&nbsp;<td>pardon me</td><td></td><td>avast</td>
<tr><td><td>excuse me</td><td></td><td>arrr</td>
<tr><td>People:<td>sir</td><td></td><td>matey</td>
<tr><td><td>madam</td><td></td><td>proud beauty</td>
<tr><td><td>officer</td><td></td><td>foul blaggart</td>
<tr><td>Questions:<td>where is</td><td></td><td>whar be</td>
<tr><td><td>can you help me find</td><td></td><td>know ye</td>
<tr><td><td>is that</td><td></td><td>be that</td>

As the vocabulary of your pirate translator grows, the buttons in the page can appear 
cluttered.  
In particular, finding the button corresponding to a desired word or phrase can become 
a chore.  
Add an HTML table to 
your page to organize the buttons by category.  For example, all greetings should 
appear 
together on the same row, with 
the label "Greetings:" in the left column.  Similarly, all people should be grouped 
together on 
a row with the text 
label "People:", and so on for each category of speech.  The screen shot below shows a 
sample 
page using a table to 
organize the layout.  Feel free to add other elements to the page (e.g., pirate images) 
to 
improve its appearance.

<h3>Automatic Code Generation</h3>

<p>As you no doubt noticed, each button in the <tt>pirate1.html</tt> page is 
of the same form.  Individual buttons differ only in the button label (the word/phrase 
to 
be translated) and the translated word/phrase added to the text area.  
With a little more programming knowledge, it should be possible to automate the 
generation of the buttons so that the programmer would not need to add new
buttons every time the vocabulary expands.  Instead, the programmer could enter 
the words and phrases in a single list (denoted with <tt>[</tt> and <tt>]</tt> 
in JavaScript) and then have the buttons generated via JavaScript when the page loads.  
This can be accomplished with the following
code, which uses a list named PHRASES to store the English and pirate words (preceded 
by 
category headings).

<p> 
<table border=1>
<tr><td>
<font size=-1><xmp>

<script type="text/javascript">
   PHRASES = [["Greetings", "hello", "ahoy", "pardon me", "avast", 
               "excuse me", "arrr"],
              ["People", "stranger", "scurvy dog", "sir", "matey", 
               "madam", "proud beauty"],
              ["Questions", "where is", "whar be",
               "can you help me find", "know ye", "is that", "be that"],
              ["Articles", "the", "th'", "my", "me", "your", "yer"], 
              ["Places", "restroom", "head", "restaurant", "galley", 
               "hotel", "fleabag inn"] 
             ];
		
   document.write("<table>");		  
   for (var i = 0; i < PHRASES.length; i++) {
       var category = PHRASES[i][0];
       document.write("<tr valign='top'><td>" + category + ": <td>");
        
       for (var j = 1; j < PHRASES[i].length; j+=2) {
           document.write("<input type=\"button\" value=\"" + PHRASES[i][j] +
                          "\" onClick=\"document.getElementById(\'outputArea\').value = " + 
                          "document.getElementById(\'outputArea\').value + \'" +
                          PHRASES[i][j+1] + " \';\" />\n");
       }
       document.write("</td></tr>");
   }
   document.write("</table>");
</script>
</xmp></font>
</table>

<B><FONT COLOR="red">EXERCISE 4:</FONT></B> &nbsp;&nbsp;
Save a copy of your <tt>pirate1.html</tt> page under the name <tt>pirate2.html</tt>.  
Then, modify this new page by replacing all of the buttons in the body with  
the above JavaScript code segment.  Once you have tested
the page to be sure that it behaves as described, extend it by adding your new words 
and 
phrases to the 
PHRASES list.  When finished, this new page should behave exactly as your 
<tt>pirate1.html</tt> from EXERCISE 4.  However, adding additional words and phrases 
should now be as easy as adding the new words and phrases to the PHRASES list.
