        <h3>Lab to accompany <a href="http://dave-reed.com/book">

<p>This lab will demonstrate the use of computer programs as
experimental tools for solving problems.  Utilizing a Web page with
embedded JavaScript code, you will perform experiments with word
distributions and attempt to estimate the number of words with certain
properties.  Many of the labs in this course will similarly emphasize
the use of computers for modeling complex phenomena or for analyzing
data, and so will help to develop empirical skills such as formulating
reasonable hypotheses, designing experiments, executing them, and
critiquing the results. </p>

<h3>JavaScript in a Web Page</h3>

<p>The Web page <A HREF="randSeq.html">randSeq.html</A> contains
JavaScript code for generating random sequences of letters.  By
default, clicking on the button labeled "Click to generate letter
sequences" within the page will generate and display a single sequence
of 3 random letters, e.g., "<tt>syk</tt>".  By changing a value in the
appropriate box, however, the number of random sequences, the length
of each sequence, and even the possible letters in each sequence can
be changed. </p>

<P> You are not expected to understand JavaScript code yet, but you may find it 
interesting to look at the 
actual code for generating random letter sequences.  View the HTML source for the 
<TT>randSeq.html</TT> page 
(by selecting <TT>Source</TT> under the Internet Explorer <TT>View</TT> menu).  
There are two sections of 
code 
in the HEAD of this page, delineated by <TT>&lt;script 
type="text/javascript"&gt;</TT> and 
<TT>&lt;/script&gt;</TT> tags.  The first section of code loads a library of 
JavaScript routines called 
<TT>random.js</TT>, including code for generating a random character.  The second 
section of code contains 
the 
definitions of two functions that generate and display the random sequences that 
appear in the page.  The 
text in the body of 
the page sets up the layout of the page and executes the JavaScript code when the 
user clicks on the button.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><FONT COLOR="red">EXERCISE 5:</FONT></B> &nbsp;&nbsp;
What are the names of the two JavaScript functions that generate and display the 
random letter sequences?  Note that each function name 
follows the keyword <TT>function</TT> in the code section found in the HEAD of the 
page.

<H3>Simple Experiments</H3>

<P> Using the random sequence generator page, you can perform some interesting 
experiments.  In particular, 
you 
can use this code as a tool for verifying or disproving hypotheses about word 
distributions, and to generate 
further data for analysis.  First, consider the total number of unique 3-letter 
sequences that can be 
generated.  Since each of the three positions in a sequence can be any of the 26 
letters, there are <FONT 
SIZE=-1>26<SUP>3</SUP></FONT> = 17,576 different sequences.  Clearly, not all of 
these sequences form real 
words.  The question arises:  how many random 3-letter sequences would you expect 
to have to generate before 
you obtain a word?   </P>

<P> It so happens that there are approximately 500 3-letter words in the English 
language (according to a 
popular online dictionary).  Thus, if you generated a random 3-letter sequence, 
there is a 500 out of 17,576 
chance that it will be a word.  Since 500/17,567 is approximately 1/35, you might 
expect 1 out of every 35 
sequences to be a word.  More accurately, you might expect 28 out of every 1000 
random 3-letter sequences to 
be 
words, since 1/35 is approximately 2.8%.  This number can be verified 
experimentally using the 
<tt>randSeq.html</tt> Web page. </P>


<P><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><FONT COLOR="red">EXERCISE 6:</FONT></B> &nbsp;&nbsp;
Use the Web page to generate 1000 random 3-letter sequences and count how many 
English words you obtain.  
List 
that number below.  <I>Hint:</I> Since 1000 sequences will not fit on the screen at 
one time, generate the 
sequences in 10 groups of 100.  Scanning 100 sequences for words can be done in 
just a few seconds. </P>

<P><BR><BR><BR><BR></P>

<P>Is the number you obtained close to the expected value of 28?  If not, try 
generating another 500 or 1000 
sequences and see if the approximation (number of words / number of sequences 
generated) improves.  

<P><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> As the length of the letter sequences increases, the chances of generating a 
word at random decreases 
dramatically.  For example, there are 1,777 4-letter words in the online 
dictionary.  Thus, the chances of 
generating a 4-letter word at random are 1 in 257 (1,777/<FONT 
SIZE=-1>26<SUP>4</SUP></FONT> = 1,777/456,976 
= 
1/257).  For 5-letter sequences, the chances of generating a word at random is 1 in 
4,920 (2,415/<FONT 
SIZE=-1>26<SUP>5</SUP></FONT> = 2,415/11,881,376 = 1/4,920) .    </P>

Use the Web page to generate 1000 random 4-letter sequences and count how many

that number below.   </P>

<P><BR><BR><BR><BR></P>

<P>Since there is only a 0.38% chance of generating a 4-letter word at random, you 
would expect to obtain 
around 4 words out of 1000 random 4-letter sequences.  Is the number you obtained 
close to 4?  Compared to 
the 
case for 3-letter words, would you expect it to take more or fewer sequences to 
obtain a number close to the 
expected value?  Explain.

<H3>Problem Solving via Experimentation</H3>

<P> Part of the blame for the scarcity of words among randomly generated sequences 
falls on letters such as 
'q' 
and 'z'.  Since these letters are used so infrequently in English, their inclusion 
in a random sequence of 
letters makes a real word extremely unlikely.  If we exclude letters such as these, 
however, we can improve 
the 
chances of generating words considerably.  For example, the 10 letters that appear 
most frequently in English 
text are "etaoinshrd".   Random sequences of these letters would appear more likely 
to produce words.</P>

<P><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><FONT COLOR="red">EXERCISE 8:</FONT></B> &nbsp;&nbsp;
Modify the appropriate field in the Web page so that it generates random sequences 
using only the letters 
"etaoinshrd".  Generate 1000 random 3-letter sequences of these letters and count 
how many English words you 
obtain.  List that number below.

<P><BR><BR><BR><BR></P>

Is the number you obtained relatively consistent with the number obtained by the 
person sitting next to you 
(e.g., within 10% of each other)?  If not, generate more sequences and add the word 
counts until your totals 
are closer. 

<P><BR><BR><BR><BR></P>

<P>
Using your experimental results from the previous exercise, you should now be able 
to estimate the number of 
3-letter words in the English language that use only the letters in "etaoinshrd".  
The followng general 
formula 
applies:

<XMP>
    # of words = (# of possible sequences) * (chances that random sequence is word)
</XMP>

The total number of 3-letter sequences that use only 10 letters is <FONT 
SIZE=-1>10<SUP>3</SUP></FONT> = 
1,000.  
As an estimate of the chances that a random sequence of these letters is a word, 
divide the number of words 
you 
obtained by the total number of sequences you generated.  For example, suppose you 
generated 1500 random 
sequences, 150 of which were actual words.  You could then estimate the chances of 
randomly generating a word 
to be 150/1500 = 1/10.  Plugging these numbers into the above formula, the total 
number of 3-letter words 
using 
only "etaoinshrd" is estimated to be (1,000 * 1/10) = 100.   </P>

Using the same approach as above, estimate the number of 4-letter words using only 
the letters "etaoinshrd".  
Show your work in obtaining your estimate.

<P><I>Note:</I> since there are many more 4-letter sequences than there are 
3-letter sequences, it may take 
many more random generations in order to obtain a reasonable estimate.  Justify 
your data.
