<H1>The Let's Make a Deal Applet</H1>As a motivating example behind the=20
discussion of probability, an applet has been developed which allows =
students to=20
investigate the Let's Make a Deal Paradox. This paradox is related to a =
popular=20
television show in the 1970's. In the show, a contestant was given a =
choice of=20
three doors of which one contained a prize. The other two doors =
contained gag=20
gifts like a chicken or a donkey. After the contestant chose an initial =
door,=20
the host of the show then revealed an empty door among the two unchosen =
doors,=20
and asks the contestant if he or she would like to switch to the other =
unchosen=20
door. The question is should the contestant switch. Do the odds of =
winning=20
increase by switching to the remaining door?=20
<P>The intuition of most students tells them that each of the doors, the =
chosen=20
door and the unchosen door, are equally likely to contain the prize so =
that=20
there is a 50-50 chance of winning with either selection. This, however, =
is not=20
the case. The probability of winning by using the switching technique is =
2/3=20
while the odds of winning by not switching is 1/3. The easiest way to =
explain=20
this to students is as follows. The probability of picking the wrong =
door in the=20
initial stage of the game is 2/3. If the contestant picks the wrong door =

initially, the host must reveal the remaining empty door in the second =
stage of=20
the game. Thus, if the contestant switches after picking the wrong door=20
initially, the contestant will win the prize. The probability of winning =
by=20
switching then reduces to the probability of picking the wrong door in =
the=20
initial stage which is clearly 2/3.=20
<P>Despite a very clear explanation of this paradox, most students have =
a=20
difficulty understanding the problem. It is very difficult to conquer =
the strong=20
intuition which most students have in this case. As a challenge to =
students who=20
don't believe the explanation, an instructor may ask the students to =
actually=20
play the game a number of times by switching and by not switching and to =
keep=20
track of the relative frequency of wins with each strategy. An applet =
has=20
developed which allows students to repeatedly play the game and keep =
track of=20
the results. The applet is given below.=20
<P>
<CENTER><APPLET codeBase=3Dclasses height=3D350 width=3D500=20
code=3DLetsMakeaDeal.class></APPLET> </CENTER>
<P>Within the applet, the computer plays the role of the host. Upon =
loading the=20
applet, students are asked to pick a door by clicking the mouse on the =
proper=20
region. After the initial pick, the computer reveals an empty door by =
displaying=20
a picture of a donkey behind one of the numbers. The students then have =
the=20
option of staying with their initial selection or switching to the =
remaining=20
door. The computer keeps track of the number of times the game is played =
with=20
each strategy and the number of times the game is won with each =
strategy. This=20
information is displayed at the bottom of the applet after each game. =
Using=20
empirical techniques, the student is then able to see the strategy with =
the=20
highest probability of winning as the relative frequencies converge to =
the true=20
probabilities. An instructor may use this game to motivate the ideas of =
repeated=20
trials as a means for investigating a random phenomena.=20
