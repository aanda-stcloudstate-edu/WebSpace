Rewrite your solution to
<a href="http://web.stcloudstate.edu/aanda/cs200/lab10w10.html">Lab 10</a> to use loops.<br>
The number of times you will need to loop can be computed as the <i>number of
    digits of the smallest base</i>.<br>
[<i>Note</i>: the number of digits of an integer <i>N</i> in the smaller base is:
<tt>1 + &lfloor;
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Math/log">log</a>
</tt><font size=-1><sub>[smaller base]</sub></font><tt>(N)</tt> &rfloor; ]<br>
[<i>Note</i>: the JavaScript <tt>log()</tt> function returns the <i>natural</i> log [base <i>e</i>] of its argument.  See
<a href="http://oakroadsystems.com/math/loglaws.htm#NewBase">here</a> or
<a href="http://www.purplemath.com/modules/logrules4.htm">here</a>
for a reminder and restatement of the formulae for changing logarithm bases.]<br>
(By convention, we often write <tt>log</tt><sub><i>e</i></sub><tt>()</tt> as <tt>ln</tt><tt>()</tt>, and similarly,
we often write <tt>log</tt><sub>2</sub><tt>()</tt> as <tt>lg()</tt>.
Sometimes, <tt>log()</tt> means <tt>log</tt><sub>10</sub><tt>()</tt>.)
<P>
The integers can now be larger in value than 255 [2<sup>8</sup>-1].

Create a Web-page with the following elements:
<ol type=I>
    <li> Standard identifying information.
    <ol>
	<li> The file name will be <tt>Homework4.html</tt> in your CS200 directory.
	<li> The title (what's displayed on the top bar of the browser window)
	     will include:
	 <ul>
	     <li>Your name
	     <li>the course
	     <li>the assignment &amp; number
	     <li>the date
	 </ul>
	 <li> Centered at the top of the Web-page will be the same information
	     that is in the title.
    </ol>
    <li> Create a text-box based base conversion facility based on your Lab 9 program<br> In addition to the functionality you built into your Lab 9 program, your homework assignment will have the following additional features:
    <ul>
	<li>Each text box containing the representation of a value to some base will have a corresponding text box for representing that base.<br>
	A valid base will be an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive {[2..10]}.<br>
	<i>(Be sure to ensure that it is an integer)</i>
	<li><b>Alert</b> the user with a descriptive message if the they have entered:
	<ul>
	    <li>a necessary textbox is empty. (you can use the
	    <a href="http://www.codetoad.com/javascript/isempty.asp">IsEmpty()</a>
	    function or its contents)
	    <li>a <u>base</u> which violates the above precondition.
	    <li>a <u>digit</u> which is not valid for that base.
	    <li>a <u>value</u> for conversion which is negative or not an integer (you can use the
	    <a href="http://www.codetoad.com/javascript/isnumeric.asp">IsNumeric()</a>
	    function)
	</ul>
    </ul>
</ol>

You can use this
<a href="http://www.efunda.com/units/base_n.cfm?base_from=10">on-line base conversion</a> Web-page to help you validate your conversions.<p>
After testing thoroughly (<i>especially the set of alerts generated when <u>any</u> of the preconditions are violated</i>), submit this file to its D2L Dropbox.
