<P>
<HR>
Rewrite your solution to
<a href="http://web.stcloudstate.edu/aanda/cs200/hw2f06.html">Homework 2</a> to use loops.<br>
The number of times you will need to loop can be computed as the <i>number of
digits of the smallest base</i>.<br>
The number of digits of a number N in the smaller base is
<tt>1 +
    <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference:Global_Objects:Math:log">log</a>
</tt><font size=-1><sub>[smaller base]</sub></font><tt>(N)</tt><br>
The numbers can now be larger in value than 255.

<P>
Create a Webpage with the following elements:
<ol type=I>
    <li> Standard identifying information.
    <ol>
	<li> The file name will be <tt>Homework4.html</tt> in your CS200 directory.
	<li> The title (what's displayed on the top bar of the browser window)
	     will include:
	 <ul>
	     <li>Your name
	     <li>the course
	     <li>the assignment &amp; number
	     <li>the date
	 </ul>
	 <li> Centered at the top of the Webpage will be the same information
	     that is in the title.
    </ol>
    <li> Create a text-box based base conversion facility based on your Lab 6 program<br> In addition to the functionality you built into your Lab 6 program, your homework assignment will have the following additional features:
    <ul>
	<li>Each value text box will have a corresponding text box for representing the base <br>
	A valid base will be an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive.<br>
	<i>(Be sure to ensure that it is an integer)</i>
	<li><b>Alert</b> the user with a descriptive message if the they have entered a base which violates the above precondition.
	<li><b>Alert</b> the user with a descriptive message if the they have entered a value for conversion which is negative or not an integer<br>
	<i>(This means you have to test for an equivalent value for each valid base)</i>
    </ul>
</ol>
<P>
<HR>
After testing thoroughly (<i>especially the set of alerts generated when <u>any</u> of the preconditions are violated</i>), submit this file to its D2L Dropbox.
