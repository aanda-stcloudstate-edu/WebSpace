<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>
This lab exercises the ability to:
<ul>
    <li>Write, run, and test an assembly language program for Reed's
	<a href="http://balance3e.com/Ch14/machine.html">Complete Knob&amp;Switch Computer Simulator</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Lab Assignment:</h2>

<p>
For the following two exercises, before programming the simulator, write down your assembly program on paper and walk through it.<br>
(Hint: at first, use variables for your data memory addresses, then when your code passes your walk-through, and you know the address of the halt statement, then replace the variables with the
appropriate addresses)
<p>
Perform the following Exercises:
<ol>
    <li> <u>Exercise 14.13</u> with the following modification
    <ul>
	<li>use the memory location immediately following the <tt>HALT</tt> instruction as your (<i>input</i>) operand.
	<li>use the memory location immediately following the input operand as your (<i>output</i> result) product destination.
	<li>use only one register.
    </ul>
    <li> Multiply together the positive integers in the first two memory locations follwing the <tt>HALT</tt> 
    command.  Store the (result) product in the third memory location following the <tt>HALT</tt> instruction.<br>
    [<i>HINT</i>: create a loop for which every iteration adds one operand to a running sum (<i>which will represent the product at the end</i>) while decrementing the other operand.
    Stop the loop and store the (resulting) product when the decremented value is zero. (consider using the <tt>BZERO</tt> instruction)]
    <li> <b>Extra Credit</b>: Raise the positive value in the first of two memory locations follwing the <tt>HALT</tt> instruction to the power of the positive value in the second memory location and store in the third.
</ol>
    <p>
    <b>Note</b>: the assembly language manual for the Complete Knob&amp;Switch Computer Simulator is
    <a href="http://balance3e.com/Ch14/instructions.html">here</a>.
    <p>
    When correct, submit <u>screenshots</u> of the simulator, <i>before</i> and <i>after</i> the your assembly language program runs on the simulator, to the appropriate D2L dropbox.
