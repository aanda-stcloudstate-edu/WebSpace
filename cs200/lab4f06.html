<h2>Introduction:</h2>
This lab exercises the ability to:
<ul>
    <li> Outline </li>
    <li> Develop an algorithm </li>
</ul>
<h2>Lab Assignment:</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Create a new Webpage in a new folder, <i>lab4</i>, and move to it.</li>
    <li> With another partner, on paper, write an algorithm for directing an <i>intelligent</i>
    robot what to do when entering a dimly lit room.  The light in the ceiling is burned
    out, but the robot doesn't know that. (the switch has to be thrown first.  There could
    have been a power failure, so after the bulb is changed, it has to be tested.)<br>
    The robot knows where in the room the following are located:
    <ul>
	<li>the light switch
	<li>the light bulb in the ceiling
	<li>the ladder to get to the ceiling bulb
	<li>the replacement bulb
    </ul>
    <li> Individually, express this algorithm on your new Webpage, as an outline, using a
    hierarchichally ordered list.
    <li>Also, on your new Webpage, write the answers to the following questions on page 153
        of Reed:
    <ul>
	<li>17 &amp; 18
	<li>19 &amp; 20
    </ul>
    Use the applets in the <a href="http://www.prenhall.com/reed/chapters.html">Chapter 8 Resources</a>.
</ol>

When finished, submit to the dropbox.
