Introduction:</h2>
This lab provides experience with defining functions.
<h2>
Lab Assignment:</h2>

<ol>
<ol>
<li>
Create a new directory, <i>lab6</i>, and move to it.</li>

<li>
Write&nbsp; a working program and, function which it calls, which requests
a floating point number (to round) from the user, and an integer from the
user to determine how many decimal places to round.
</li>

<ol>
<li>
You can use the expressions from Exercise 9 of Section 4-11 of your C++ text,
and your lecture notes to help you develop your algorithm and functions.
</li>

<li>
Ensure that your program and function has updated <u>comment </u>headers
describing your identifying information, the date, and the purpose of the
program or function. Each user defined function should document what each
parameter is and whether they are IN, OUT, or IN/OUT.</li>

<li>
Use a function to <u>Prompt</u> the user with explicit instructions on
entering the number to be rounded and the number of digits to round.
The number of digits to round should be between zero and six inclusive.
</li>

<li>
<u>Write</u> the output using another function.  The output will display
the original number, the number of digits to round, and the rounded value.
</li>

<li>
Compile and run.&nbsp; make sure the program is working correctly.&nbsp;
Use 1.456789 as the input number.  Test with rounding to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
and 6 decimal places.</li>

<li>
When correct, generate a printout of the source, and demonstrate, via
typescript, the running of the program for "checkout".</li>
</ol>
