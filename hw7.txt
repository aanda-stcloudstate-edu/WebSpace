 Programming assignment 7

 CSCI 201 [1,3] Fall 2002

 Due Wednesday, December 11, 2002

Objective:

This assignment is designed to exercise your facility with
one and two dimensional arrays.

Problem:

Design a program which reads daily temperature lows for a
year from a text file, computes summary statistics from
the file, and then writes its contents and its summary statistics
to another text file.

Specifications:

1. Copy the temperature file from ~cs201400/FAI1965.txt to
  your directory

2. Your program will:

  (a) read in the file

  (b) print the file to the output changing the month numbers
    in the top line to the respective three character month
    names. Also, print the 999 values, which indicate no
    day of that month in the table, as a triple of asterisks.

  (c) under each month, your program will print that month's:

    i. minimum

    ii. maximum

    iii. arithmetic mean (average)

    iv. standard deviation

    v. median

    vi. mode

  (d) In the first column, your program will print the labels
    for the above statistics

  (e) On lines following the above statistics, your program
    will print, with adequate labeling, the global statistics
    for the file (e.g. maximum temp. for the year)

3. You will then turn in a typescript of the program source
  and the output file.

Notes:

* The standard deviation, \sigma ,
  is derived from the arithmetic mean, \overline{x},
  using the following formula: \sigma =\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\left( \begin{array}{c}
n\\
\sum \\
i=1
\end{array}(x_{i}-\overline{x})^{2}\right) }

* The months have different counts of days. You can use the
  999 values of extra days in the month as a sentinel, but
  don't include them in your calculations. The n
  in the above formula and the formulae for the other statistics
  will represent the number of actual days in each respective
  month, or the number of days in the year.

* The mode and median are described in problem 8-36 in the
  text. You may use any sort in computing the median.
