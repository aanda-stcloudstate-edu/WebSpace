REQUIRED TEXT:	* Modeling Reality: How Computers Mirror Life.
		    by Bialynicki-Birula & Bialynicki-Birula, Oxford, 2004.
		* Nexus: Small Worlds and the Groundbreaking Theory of Networks,
		    by Mark Buchanan, Norton, 2002.
Supplemental TEXT: * The Computational Beauty of Nature: Computer Explorations
		    of Fractals, Chaos, Complex Systems, and Adaptation.
		    by Gary William Flake, MIT, 2000.
OBJECTIVES:
    For well over a century, the method we use to learn about the world
    around us, the scientific method, consisted of two principal components:
    theory and experiment. Beginning in the mid-20th century, a third principal
    component emerged: Computational Science. Computational Science can be
    defined as the computer simulation of (usually) simplified models of how
    real world physical or social systems work to better understand those
    systems. E.g. one may computationally model evolution to test evolutionary
    theories in biology: Computational Evolution. Or conversely, one may use
    models of evolution to better solve problems in mathematics and computer
    science: Evolutionary Computation. This course will explore how computer
    models of reality are developed, and survey a number of diverse
    applications. For example, we'll discuss why weather prediction, and some
    other predictions about the future, can be not just hard, but impossible,
    no matter how powerful a computer one uses -- why whether or not a
    butterfly flaps it wings might possibly be the determining factor with
    respect to whether a tornado forms. There will be guest lecturers and a
    possible field trip to an important computing site.

TOPICS:
    * TBD

PREREQUISITES:
    Because mathematical notation will be used in the course, the student
    must at least have mastered MATH 072 level material (intermediate algebra).
    Readiness to take calculus would be better still. Computer Science majors
    in the course may serve as mentors to students less familiar with
    computational ideas.  Thus, working groups may mix Honors students and
    Computer Science students, thereby promoting good learning for everyone in
    the class.

ASSIGNMENTS:
    There will be a modeling project.

ACADEMIC HONESTY:
    You are expected to do your own homework.  If you copy someone else's
    work or allow someone else to copy your work, you are being academically
    dishonest and will be subject to severe disciplinary action which may
    include any or all of: no credit for the work in question, a failing grade
    for the course, notification to the university that you have violated your
    Code of Conduct.  Use of recording devices during exams is prohibited.
    If you must quote or paraphrase another source, citation is essential,
    otherwise plagiarism has been committed.  You are expected to be familiar
    with your rights and obligations as outlined in the "Code of Conduct"

DECORUM: Conduct yourself so as not to distract others. In particular
    * Turn off all cell phones, watch alarms, and similar devices.
    * Do not engage in distracting activities like reading a newspaper
      or sleeping. (some of you snore...)
    * Arrive for class on time, and be ready to begin.
      If you must be late, be quiet.
    * If you are early, sit toward the middle of a row.
    * Do not start packing up before class ends.

ATTENDANCE:
    You are responsible for knowing what happens at each class meeting.

EXAMS:
    There will be a small set of intermediate exams and a comprehensive
    final exam.
    Exams will be based on the notes; that is, on the presentations in class
    as well as on the content in the assigned readings.
    Make-up exams will be given in only in extreme (or university
    sanctioned) circumstances and only with prior notice.

GRADING:
	Your grade will be determined by the contributions of your scores
	on assignments,  quizzes, intermediate and final exams.
	Makeup of tests, quizzes, and exams are by prior arrangement only.


FINAL EXAM: Monday, May 8 15:45AM - 18:15PM in MC 206.

CAVEAT:
    I reserve the right to amend the contents of this syllabus with
    notification.
