      <h1>Paradoxes</h1>
      <h2>Russell's Paradox</h2>
         <p> The Twentieth Century logician Bertrand Russell
         introduced a curious paradox: <b>This statement is
         false.</b> The statement can't be true, because it
         claims the converse. However, if it is not true, then
         it's false, just as it says. That makes it true.
         Paradoxically, it seems to be neither true nor false,
         or perhaps both true and false.</p>

      <h2> Magritte's Paradox</h2>
         <p> The famous Belgian artist Ren&eacute;
         Magritte rendered the idea of Russell's Paradox
         visually in his famous painting <i>Ceci n'est pas une
         pipe</i>. The title translates from French, This Is Not
         A Pipe. The painting shows a pipe with the text
         <i>Ceci n'est pas une pipe</i> below it. Superficially,
         the painting looks like a true statement, since it is a
         <i>picture</i> of the pipe, not an actual pipe. However,
         the assertion is also part of the picture, which seems
         to make it false, because it is clearly a painting of a
         pipe. Paradoxically, the truth seems to depend on
         whether the statement is an assertion about the painting
         or a part of it. But, it's both.</p>
