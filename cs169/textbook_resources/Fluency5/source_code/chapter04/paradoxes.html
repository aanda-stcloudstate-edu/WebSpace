         <p>The Twentieth Century logician Bertrand <a href="Russellbio.html" 
         style="color:aqua"> Russell</a> introduced a curious paradox:  
         <b style="color:red">This statement is false.</b> The  statement can't 
         be true, because it claims the converse. However, if it is not true, then 
         it's false, just as it says. That makes it true. Paradoxically, it seems to be 
         neither true nor false, or perhaps both true and false.</p>

      <h2 style="color:darkorange; font-family:arial">Magritte's Paradox</h2>
         <p><img src="pipe.jpg" width="192" style="float:right" alt="Pipe painting"/> 
         The famous Belgian artist Ren&eacute; <a href="Magrittebio.html" style=
         "color:aqua">Magritte</a> rendered the idea of  Russell's Paradox visually 
         in his famous painting <i>Ceci n'est pas  une pipe</i>. 
         The title translates from French, This Is Not A Pipe. The painting shows a 
         pipe with the text <i>Ceci n'est pas une pipe</i>  below it. Superficially, 
         the painting looks like a true statement, since it is a <i>picture</i> of 
         the pipe, not an actual pipe. However, the assertion is also part of the 
         picture, which seems to  make it false, because it is clearly a painting of 
         a pipe.  Paradoxically, the truth seems to depend on whether the 
         statement is an assertion about the painting or a part of it. But, it's both.
