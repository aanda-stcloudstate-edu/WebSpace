      <cool><title>The Digital Diary</title>
          This will be fun! I start my digital journal today. So, to launch it with the right sentiment,
          I looked up what Henry David Thoreau wrote on the first day of his famous <ital>Journal.</ital> 
          He wrote, <quote>"'What are you doing now?' he asked. 'Do you keep a journal?' So I make my 
          first entry today."</quote> Which, I guess, is pretty much what I just said. Great minds ... !

        It's so totally awesome! It's been a month 
        since a Toronto team won the Sikorsky Prize, but OMG, I can't stop thinking about it! 
        So, I start this journal with Da Vinci's dream-come-true!  
        <ytvid file="https://www.youtube.com/embed/syJq10EQkog"/>
        Sikorsky requires: Be aloft 60 seconds; rise to 3 m; stay inside a 10m x 10m square. In the

       <cool>I ran across this today, and am saving it here so I don't lose track of it. It needs more reading.

       <title>Potentially Hazardous Astroids</title>
         Wow! I read so much poetry, I missed yesterday's APOD!  
         NASA has plotted the orbits of the inner planets, and potentially hazardous astroids. 
         Hmm ... don't a lot of 'em cross Earth's orbit?<para>

     <title>Science Finally Asks Permission</title>
         Last year I read<ital>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</ital> by Rebecca Skloot. 
         Lacks was a poor African American tobacco farmer and mother of five, who died of 
         cervical cancer in 1951 at age 31.  Doctors at Johns Hopkins took cancer cells from 
         her without permission.  Because her cells continue to grow in the lab, they're key to 
         medical research. Skloot profiles her and her family, stressing their confusion and 
         hurt because her cells cured diseases; scientists got fame, she got nothing. HeLa 
         cells, cited in 70,000 scientific papers, are <ital>still </ital>growing 60 years later. 
         <bold> Immortal!</bold>

         <pic file="im/lacks.jpg" width = "100"/> <pic file="im/hela.jpg" width="390"/></para>
         Her genome has now been sequenced. Today the National Institutes of Health set up a 
         board to approve research with her genome; 2 family members sit on the board. Finally!
