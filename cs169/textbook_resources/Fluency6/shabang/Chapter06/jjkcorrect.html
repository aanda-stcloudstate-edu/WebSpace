    <p> <br/> It sounds bold to claim that Jackie Joyner-Kersee is the absolute best female athlete, but 
           consider this: She competed in the heptathlon, a track and field event that combines scores from
           seven different sports. She won two Olympic <span class="au">gold</span> medals in heptathlon 
           (and a <span class="ag">silver</span>), and still holds the world record for greatest number of 
           points ever scored: 7,291.</p>
     <p><b style="color:darkred">How good was she?</b> First, she competed in heptathlon, meaning 
            she was Olympic caliber in 100m hurdles, 200m, 800m, high jump, long jump, javelin and shot 
            put. Also, she won Olympic <span class="au">gold</span> in long jump and two <span class="bz">bronzes.
            </span> Add to that two World Championship <span class="au"> golds</span> in heptathlon and two 
            <span class="au">golds </span> in long jump, and a long jump <span class="au">gold </span> in the 
            Pan American Games. She also played  starting forward all four years of college at UCLA in basketball. </p>
     <p><b style="color:darkred">No One Better. </b>
            But probably the most impressive fact about her abilities is that only two other women have ever 
            been able to score more than 7000 points in heptathlon,  Carolina Kl√ºft (7032) of Sweden and 
            Larisa Turchinskaya (7007) of the Soviet Union. For comparison, the table at right lists the seven 
            sports of heptathlon, JJK's 7291-year (1988), her personal best, and the performance needed in 
            each of the seven sports to earn 1000 points. (The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heptathlon">
            scoring in heptathlon </a> is bizarre.)</p>
    <p><b style="color:darkred">Inspiration</b> Jackie Joyner-Kersee has said in her autobiography <i>A Kind
            of Grace</i> that as a young girl she was inspired to be a versatile athlete by a movie about Babe Didrikson 
            Zaharias, who was a track star, basketball player and pro golfer, and ironically, considered the All-Time 
            Best Female Athlete before JJK.</p>
