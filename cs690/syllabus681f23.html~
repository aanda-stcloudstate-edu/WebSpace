Hyflex Content Delivery and Accessibility:
I plan to teach using a blend of synchronous and asynchronous delivery via Zoom and D2L,
where it should make no effective and essential difference whether at any time you are F2F or remote.
I intend to record all lectures.  And, most materials will be available through D2L.
Student submissions of quizzes, assignments, notes, etc. will be via a D2L dropbox.
This plan should maximize flexibility for both you and me to adapt to whatever factors change progressively
or suddenly for either you or me.
You will never be expected to be F2F in our classroom.
My default mode of presentation is <u>synchronous</u>.
Your default Zoom mode of access should be with your camera on, and your mute <i>must</i> be on.
If you are connecting synchronously through Zoom, you are encouraged to contribute at any time by unmuting, or by Zoom text.
Here's the SCSU definition of Hyflex (from the Provost's Fall 2021 Instructional Resource and Support Guide):
    <i><b>Hyflex Course - Course activity is both online and in-person, at the same time, offering students flexibility with their learning.</b></i>
    In a hyflex course, all learning activities are delivered via asynchronous online, synchronous online, and in-person.
    With faculty consultation, a student may choose which mode of learning works best for their circumstance.
    Although there are asynchronous learning activities, the course is not self-paced.
    Meetings are online (both synchronous (scheduled) and asynchronous) and in-person.
    Exams are typically in-person and synchronous online (not asynchronous).
    In-person and synchronous meeting/exam dates and times are often scheduled in ISRS (registration system) and in the syllabus.
    Media code 14.

REQUIRED TEXT:  * Writing for Computer Science, 3rd ed.,
                  Justin Zobel, Springer, 2014


<A HREF="https://catalog.stcloudstate.edu/courses/00016052">SCSU COURSE CATALOG DESCRIPTION:</A> (for CSCI 681)
    Oral presentation with appropriate visual aids on current topics in computer science for a select audience.
    One semester of graduate coursework required and permission of instructor.

DESCRIPTION:
   In practice, this course has evolved beyond the course catalog description.
   This course is now taught as a technical writing and research methods course preparing the student for writing in the thesis style. 
   Towards this end, Students are expected to satisfactorily demonstrate competence in the execution of the following deliverables:
   * use of a Reference Management System
   * writing a research topic description as an extended abstract
   * writing an annotated bibliography
   * writing a research paper conforming to the SCSU graduate thesis style requirements
   * writing a slide presentation and presenting it orally.

   All of the writing deliverables must be coupled to the same research topic.

SLOs:
     None stated in the current <a href="https://catalog.stcloudstate.edu/courses/00016052">CSCI 681 SCSU course description</a>

PREREQUISITES:
    Graduate Standing in Computer Science

ACADEMIC HONESTY:
    You are expected to do your own homework.  If you copy someone else's
    work or allow someone else to copy your work, you are being academically
    dishonest and will be subject to severe disciplinary action which may
    include any or all of: no credit for the work in question, a failing grade
    for the course, notification to the university that you have violated your
    Code of Conduct.  Use of recording devices during exams is prohibited.
    If you must quote or paraphrase another source, citation is essential,
    otherwise plagiarism has been committed.  You are expected to be familiar
    with your rights and obligations as outlined in the &quot;Code of Conduct&quot;

GRADING:
        Your grade will be determined by the contributions of your scores
        on assignments,  quizzes, intermediate and final exams, term papers and their presentations.
        Makeup of tests, quizzes, and exams are by prior arrangement only.
		(Exception handling: If you have received undergraduate credit for CSCI 331 (you were a SCSU CSCI undergrad),
		 instead of taking the exams, you will write and present additional term papers on significantly different topics, and pass a Quiz on the other presented term papers)
