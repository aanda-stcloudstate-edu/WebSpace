*******************************************************************************
Student Office Hours:
The time that I have listed as office hours is time for you. 
It is time that I have dedicated to be available for whatever you need. 
This does not mean that I will stare sadly out the window waiting for a student to come – I will be doing other work. 
What it does mean is that the second you show up, that work goes away and the time is yours. 
We can talk about the course, the department, some other topic, grad school, etc. I am available for you during that time. 
Additionally, if my door is open at other times, feel free to drop by – I’m in my office often. 
If I am in but can’t talk right then, I’ll let you know, then we can chat at a different time. 

All students are encouraged to critically reflect on the course topics and to raise questions to the class and to the professor. 
Please be respectful to one another by not presenting your question in a hostile manner. 
Open dialogue on course content is encouraged, but attacks on classmates or me are not. 
Please set up a time to talk with me if you have questions about this policy or if you believe this policy is being violated. 
You may also report hostile, biased or threatening behavior to www.stcloudstate.edu/oea/
