<P> [...]
<P>What next? Well, let's back up and talk about research. 
<P>
<P><STRONG>RESEARCH </STRONG>
<P>Graduate school, as I said, is training in research. When a graduate school 
looks at your application, their principal question is, "Is this person going to 
be good at research?" Indeed, that should be one of your own principal questions 
as well. How can you tell if you're going to be good at research? Getting good 
grades in your undergraduate classes is important, but it's not really the main 
thing. The main thing is this: if you want to go to graduate school, you should 
start getting involved in research as an undergraduate. This fact is usually 
kept secret, but it's true. And in retrospect it's obvious why. Graduate school 
is a big commitment, both for you and for the department that accepts you into 
its graduate program. You should try your hand at research first so that 
everyone can make a well-informed decision. (On the other hand, if you don't 
manage to get involved in research as an undergraduate, you should go ahead and 
apply to graduate school anyway, and consider including your best undergraduate 
term paper with your application.) 
<P>How can an undergraduate get involved in research? This question has two 
answers, the official answer and the real answer. The official answer will take 
the form of administrative mechanisms (independent study courses, faculty mentor 
programs, and so forth) that provide formal structures around a project that you 
might be involved in. Go talk to your department's undergraduate coordinator, 
find out what these mechanisms are, and read the necessary paperwork. Then 
forget about them for a while, because the real answer to the question lies in 
your professional relationship to the faculty member who will supervise your 
research. But who will this person be? That's the hard part. 
<P>As with all professional relationships, you're looking for a match between 
your interests and abilities and those of a faculty member. Finding this match 
will take a little time, but like all hard projects it starts with asking 
advice. One way to start is by finding out which faculty members have supervised 
undergraduate research in the past. Teaching assistants are often a good source 
for this sort of information (and much other information as well, though you 
should realize that TA's, like everyone else, see the world from a particular 
angle and often have differing opinions). You can also start with someone whose 
course you liked and did well in. This approach has the advantage that the 
professor in question already knows you. Show up in that person's office hours 
and say, "I'd like to ask your advice. I liked your course on such-and-such and 
I'm thinking I might want to go to graduate school in that area. In particular 
I'd like to see if I can get involved in a research project in the area starting 
maybe next term. But I haven't got a precise idea of how to go about it, or 
about how to define a good project. What do you think I should do?" Maybe 
they'll just send you to someone else, or maybe they won't. 
<P>The ensuing conversation will be complicated but probably less painful than 
you think. Keep in mind that it is basically a negotiation. It is your first 
chance to practice a skill that you will need for the rest of your career as a 
scholar: formulating and reformulating your research interests in language that 
particular people can understand. Listen to their language. What do they think a 
research topic is like? How do they think a research project should be 
conducted? Do they see research as an individual activity or as a collective 
one? How enthusiastic do they really seem about the idea of supervising 
undergraduate research? Are you comfortable with the answers to these questions? 
No need to make a quick decision, though. Most likely your conversation will be 
inconclusive. That's normal. Sleep on it. Ask for research papers to read and 
then read them -- and then ask yourself if you want to learn to write papers 
like that. Have the same sort of conversation with other professors (don't 
forget other departments and even other universities in the same geographic 
area). Then compare and contrast the results. 
<P>Undergraduate research projects can take a wide variety of forms. Sometimes a 
professor will have a large research project that involves dozens of people. 
Such projects frequently have niches for undergraduates. This can be the best 
kind of undergraduate research experience because it will give you the 
opportunity to work with a group, observe the whole process of research, and 
feel like you're contributing to something. But maybe nobody has project of that 
type in your area. 
<P>Another possibility is simply to set up a project of your own, with regular 
meetings with a professor to discuss its progress. Projects like this work best 
if you have a good relationship with the professor and a strong feeling for the 
topic. Try to get to know other people with interests in that area, both because 
it's interesting and to keep from getting isolated or dependent on a particular 
professor. Your project will make a good conversation topic. 
<P>Yet another possibility is to become a professor's assistant on some project. 
This might involve anything: library work, data collection, putting together 
complex research papers, etc. The work might be tedious (or it might not), but 
it can be a good way to learn about research through apprenticeship. All such 
deals are unique and should be weighed on their particular merits (e.g., whether 
you feel that you can work for this person), but you should always give them 
serious consideration because they don't happen every day. 
<P>And the world is full of other possibilities. Maybe you will become involved 
with an off-campus project of some sort -- a company, a community group, an 
alternative media project -- that you can integrate with a university research 
project. Maybe you can get a summer job in a research group. Maybe you will have 
an outside job that you want to use as a site for field research. Who knows. Few 
research opportunities are advertised (though many universities have offices 
that find undergraduates for research projects), so you'll have to ask around. 
Most likely you'll have to make the opportunity yourself by exploring options 
with various professors. 
<P>Once you have defined a project and found a supervisor, go ahead and figure 
out the paperwork. Maybe you'll arrange for independent study credit. Maybe 
you'll sign up for some official program in the university. Maybe you'll even 
get a research grant. (If you need some money for your research, perhaps to take 
a trip or operate a photocopier, ask. It may exist. Writing a grant proposal may 
be the single most valuable experience of your project. And if you're being paid 
for your involvement in the project, make sure you get a clear understanding of 
your responsibilities to avoid misunderstandings later.) Just keep in mind that 
professional relationships are the real substance of research. Administrative 
details are secondary. Maybe you won't even formalize the arrangement at all. 
The important things, after all, are the experience you'll get, the 
relationships you'll develop, and the research paper that you can include in 
graduate school applications. 
<P>In particular, it is not crucial how well your research project turns out. It 
will be okay in any event; and everyone understands that research is hard and 
that undergraduate projects regularly fail to work out completely for reasons 
that are not your fault. (The main pitfall for undergraduates and graduate 
students alike is attempting a project that's too big. Keep asking wise people 
to help you narrow your project.) If your project works out well enough to 
produce a publishable paper, go for it. But it's not necessary.
