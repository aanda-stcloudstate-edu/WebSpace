Programming Assignment 4

Due Wednesday, Oct 23, 2002

Objective:

This assignment is designed to provide you with experience modularizing
an existing program via functions.  Using functions, you will encapsulate
source code from your previous program, hw3, in which you approximated sine
and cosine.
No conditionals, loops, or user defined data structures are
necessary to solve this problem.

Problem:

Modify your hw3 program to be modular via encapsulation of logical and
functional modules in the code by functions.  The program behavior,
as viewed by the user, should not change.


Specifications:

The following will be functions:
*  a function to encapsulate the input, output, and calculation, which calls:

* * a function to query for and read the angle.
* * a function to write the results.
* * a function to calculate the results, which calls:

* * * a function to convert the input from degrees to radians/4, where the
      4 is a default parameter.

* * * a function to compute the 5 term expansion of sine AND cosine, where
      5 is a default parameter (that we will use in a future modification),
      which calls:
* * * * a function which computes each term using the previous term as a
	parameter.

* * * a function each for the sin4x and cos4x formulae

* * * a function each for the trueSin and trueCos (you have used these
      math.h library functions already: sin(4*x) & cos(4*x))

* * * a function, called twice, to calculate the approxPercent for each.

Document each function with a sentence explaining its purpose followed by
the purpose of each parameter and whether they are IN, OUT, or IN/OUT
respectively.

SUBMIT:

* A listing of your source.

* A copy {using the Unix [script] command} of your programs output for the
  following data values: 359, 719, 1, 35641, 35639.
