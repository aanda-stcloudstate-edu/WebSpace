Lab 9</h2></center>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2> Introduction:</h2>
This lab provides experience with exploiting more efficient algorithms
to perform an identical computational task, and recursion.  The task
is to compute the integer power of a (<b>double</b>) number.
<h2> Lab Assignment:</h2>

<h4> Problem Motivation and Definition:</h4>

<P> One of the most important tasks of a computer scientist is the
identification, development, testing, and implementation of more efficient
algorithms.  In most cases, we will want the more efficient algorithm to
be as accurate as the original, but in other cases, we are willing to
settle for <i>close enough</i>.  For our current problem of raising a
number to an integer power, our answer will be at least as accurate.

<P> We will write and demonstrate three subroutines for the calculation of
integer powers of a number: (1) iterative, (2) recursive, (3) binary.


<h4> Solution Specification:</h4>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>
Create a new directory, <i>lab9</i>, and move to it.</li>

<li>
Copy ~cs201400/lab9partial.cpp to your lab9 directory.
</li>

<li>
Edit and complete lab9partial.cpp to solve the above problem,
and name the working program source lab9.cpp.
Name the executable lab9.
</li>

<li>
For each function, maintain a counter which counts the number of
multiplications.  Reset the counter between power function evaluations.
</li>

<li>
For the binary exponentiation algorithm, see:
http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/55603.html
and
http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?next=big-O
</li>

<li>
When correct, generate a printout of the source, and demonstrate, via
typescript, the source and the running of the program data for "checkout".
Use for the number: [1.01].  The powers will be: 10, 100, 1000, 10000.
</li>

</ol>
