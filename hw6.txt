CSCI 201 [1,3] Fall 2002

Programming Assignment 6

Due Friday, Nov 15, 2002

Objective:

This assignment is designed to provide you with problem solving experience
involving writing a program which modifies and builds upon a previously
solved problem.  A facility with nested loops will be exercised.

Problem:

Design a program which prints a calendar for a given year, by month,
with each week beginning with a Monday.

Specifications:

Follow the directions in problem 6-33 on pages 283-284 with the exception
of the following change: Start each week with Monday rather than Sunday.

* Use the related program you developed in Lab 7 to help you solve this
  problem.

* Maximize the readability of your program.  Follow the guidelines in
  [Appendix H] unless you can apply a more readable alternative in a
  particular context in your program.

    * Use comments to identify yourself, the date, the course and section, and
      the purpose of the program -- all at the top of your program.
      
    * Use descriptive comments and identifiers throughout your code.

* Check the correctness of your program using the Unix command "cal [year]".

SUBMIT:

* A listing of your source.

* A copy {using the Unix [script] command} of your programs output.
