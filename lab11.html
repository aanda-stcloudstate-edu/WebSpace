<h2> Introduction:</h2>
This lab implements file I/O and uses multidimensional arrays.
<h2> Lab Assignment:</h2>

<h4> Problem Motivation and Definition:</h4>

<P> Standard I/O is useful, but sometimes limiting.  Our programs can be
more flexible if we are able to read and write to files directly without
having to rely on the file redirection operators in UNIX.

<P> We will modify program 8-15 in the text to read and write from files.
Program 8-15 reads and writes two dimensional tables using two dimensional
arrays and calculates and displays row and column averages.
<br>The dimensions of the tables will be read from the first line of the input file.


<h4> Solution Specification:</h4>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>
Create a new directory, <i>lab11</i>, and move to it.</li>

<li>
Copy ~cs201400/p15mod.cpp, ~cs201400/data15.txt, and ~cs201400/data15a.txt to
your lab11 directory.
</li>

<li>
Modify program p15mod.cpp to read from <b>infile15.txt</b> and write to
<b>outfile15.txt</b>. 
<br>[See <b>Program 7-8</b> in the text for examples]
</li>

<li>
Also, perform the following modifications:
<ol>
    <li>
    Reset <b>MAX_ROWS</b> and <b>MAX_COLS</b> to be 12 and 10 respectively.
    <br>These will be the largest possible dimensions of our input table.
    </li>
    <li>
    Read the number of rows and columns from the first line of the input
    file.
    <br>They will be ordered with the row count preceding the column count.
    <br>Your program will use these values as the limit in the terminating
    expression of the respective <b>for</b> loops.
    </li>
    <li>
    Modify the <i>printTables</i> function so that the line of underscores
    is adjusted to match the number of columns input.
    </li>
    <li>
    Place column headers over each column. E.g., COL0  COL2 ... COLn  AVG 
    <br>Place another row of underscores between the column headers and the
    top row of the output table.
    </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
Run the program twice: once for the data in data15.txt and
once for the data in data15a.txt.
<br>You will need to copy each input file to <b>infile15.txt</b>
prior to running the program. 
<br>After each run terminates, rename the output to be
<b>output15.txt</b> and <b>output15a.txt</b> respectively.
</li>

<li>
When correct, generate a printout of the source and the two ouput files.
</li>

</ol>
