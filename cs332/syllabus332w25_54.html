3) Any student scheduled to have more than two final examinations on one day may request to have one of them rescheduled. Normally, the instructor with the highest numbered course will reschedule. However, if the higher numbered course is one for which a “common” exam is scheduled, the instructor of the next higher numbered, non-common exam course will reschedule. It is the student’s responsibility to request rescheduling of any examination prior to the final withdrawal date of that semester. Disputes should be referred to the appropriate dean.

Accommodations Statement
An affirmative action, equal opportunity employer, and educator, St. Cloud State University is committed to a 
policy of nondiscrimination in employment and education opportunity and works to provide reasonable accommodations 
for all persons with disabilities.

If you have a disability, or think you may have a disability, you may want to contact Student Accessibility Services 
to begin the conversation or request official accommodations. 
Visit the Student Accessibility Services website for more information or contact them at 320-308-4080 or 
Room 202 of Centennial Hall.

Student Accessibility Services works with students with disabilities and faculty members to identify reasonable 
accommodations. If you have previously been approved for accommodations through Student Accessibility Serves, 
please contact me so we can develop an implementation plan together.

Accommodation Process
•	Student Accessibility Services is St. Cloud State’s program that provides accommodations for students with 
disabilities. The goal of Student Accessibility Service is to support students with documented disabilities in 
getting equal access to SCSU courses, programs, and events through a collaborative process to provide appropriate 
and reasonable accommodations. 
•	After a Semester Accommodation Request is approved, Accommodation Letters will be emailed to notify professors 
of any students who have approved accommodations. Please read over the attached documents as these will be helpful 
for you in better understanding their accommodations. We welcome any questions or concerns you may have. 
Below are some commonly used forms and procedures you may see:
•	Testing Accommodations for students who receive a reduced distraction environment and extended time on timed 
    assessments.

All discussions will remain confidential.

Student Office Hours:
The time that I have listed as office hours is time for you. It is time that I have dedicated to be available for 
whatever you need. This does not mean that I will stare sadly out the window waiting for a student to come – 
I will be doing other work. What it does mean is that the second you show up, that work goes away and the time is 
yours. We can talk about the course, the department, some other topic, grad school, etc. 
I am available for you during that time. Additionally, if my door is open at other times, feel free to drop by – 
I’m in my office often. If I am in but can’t talk right then, I’ll let you know and we can chat at a different time. 
I am available via Zoom and in my office during my Student Office Hours.

Violence Statement

In the event that you choose to write or speak about having survived sexualized violence,
including rape, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking,
and specify that this violence occurred while you were an SCSU student,
federal and state education laws require that, as your instructor,
I notify the Title IX officer, Ellyn Bartges. 

She (or her designee), will contact you to let you know about accommodations and
support services at SCSU and possibilities for holding accountable the person who harmed you.

If you do not want the Title IX Officer notified, instead of disclosing this information to your instructor,
you can speak confidentially with the following people on campus and in the community. 

They can connect you with support services and discuss options for holding the perpetrator accountable.
