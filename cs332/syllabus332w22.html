Content Delivery and Accessibility:
I plan to teach Hyflex using a blend of synchronous and asynchronous delivery via Zoom and D2L,
where it should make no effective and essential difference whether at any time you are F2F or remote.
I intend to record and post all lectures.  And, most materials will be available through D2L.
Student submissions of quizzes, assignments, notes, etc. will be via a D2L dropbox.
This plan should maximize flexibility for both you and me to adapt to whatever factors change progressively
or suddenly for either you or me.
You will never be expected to be F2F in our classroom.
I default to synchronous delivery.


CLASS TIME AND LOCATION:

    {Lecture recordings will be posted to the D2L Discussion forum}

SAFETY:
    What to do if you have experienced sexual assault, rape, domestic violence, sexual harassment or stalking:
    Please read this resource: 
    [<A HREF="https://www5.stcloudstate.edu/Policies/SCSU/Viewer.aspx?id=60">https://www5.stcloudstate.edu/Policies/SCSU/Viewer.aspx?id=60</A>]
    Your professors fulfil the role of mandatory reporters.  If you want to speak confidentially, see the above link for

<h3>Violence Statement</h3>
<pre>
In the event that you choose to write or speak about having survived sexualized violence,
including rape, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking,
and specify that this violence occurred while you were an SCSU student,
federal and state education laws require that, as your instructor,
I notify the Title IX officer, Ellyn Bartges. 

She (or her designee), will contact you to let you know about accommodations and
support services at SCSU and possibilities for holding accountable the person who harmed you.

If you do not want the Title IX Officer notified, instead of disclosing this information to your instructor,
you can speak confidentially with the following people on campus and in the community. 

They can connect you with support services and discuss options for holding the perpetrator accountable.
