2) All 1 credit course final examinations will be held on the last regular class meeting of the course before final examination.
3) Any student scheduled to have more than two final examinations on one day may request to have one of them rescheduled. Normally, the instructor with the highest numbered course will reschedule. However, if the higher numbered course is one for which a “common” exam is scheduled, the instructor of the next higher numbered, non-common exam course will reschedule. It is the student’s responsibility to request rescheduling of any examination prior to the final withdrawal date of that semester. Disputes should be referred to the appropriate dean.
