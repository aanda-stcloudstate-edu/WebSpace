Hyflex Content Delivery and Accessibility:
I plan to teach using a blend of synchronous and asynchronous delivery via Zoom and D2L,
where it should make no effective and essential difference whether at any time you are F2F or remote.
I intend to record all lectures.  And, most materials will be available through D2L.
Student submissions of quizzes, assignments, notes, etc. will be via D2L.
This plan should maximize flexibility for both you and me to adapt to whatever factors change progressively
or suddenly for either you or me.
You will never be <i>expected</i> to be F2F in our classroom.
I will default to synchronous delivery.
Your default Zoom mode of access <i>should</i> be with your <b>camera on</b>, and your <b>mute</b> <i>must</i> be <b>on</b>
 (unless you are asking a question or commenting during the lecture).
If you are connecting synchronously through Zoom, you are encouraged to contribute at any time by unmuting, or by Zoom text.
Here's the SCSU definition of Hyflex (from the Provost's Fall 2023 Instructional Resource and Support Guide):
    <i><b>Hyflex Course - Course activity is both online and in-person, at the same time, offering students flexibility with their learning.</b></i>
    In a hyflex course, all learning activities are delivered via asynchronous online, synchronous online, and in-person.
    With faculty consultation, a student may choose which mode of learning works best for their circumstance.
    Although there are asynchronous learning activities, the course is not self-paced.
    Meetings are online (both synchronous (scheduled) and asynchronous) and in-person.
    <b>Exams</b> are typically in-person and <b>synchronous online</b> (not asynchronous).
    In-person and synchronous meeting/exam dates and times are often scheduled in ISRS (registration system) and in the syllabus.
    Media code 14.

If you cannot take an exam at it's scheduled time and date, <u>no later than the previous class period</u> contact the instructor or TA to reschedule for later <i>that day</i>.<br>
Online quizes may be offered asynchronously.

Additional Information About Finals:
1) During the week preceding final examination week each instructor will publicize the day, hour and room for the final examination and indicate how the time will be utilized.
2) All 1 credit course final examinations will be held on the last regular class meeting of the course before final examination.
3) Any student scheduled to have more than two final examinations on one day may request to have one of them rescheduled. Normally, the instructor with the highest numbered course will reschedule. However, if the higher numbered course is one for which a “common” exam is scheduled, the instructor of the next higher numbered, non-common exam course will reschedule. It is the student’s responsibility to request rescheduling of any examination prior to the final withdrawal date of that semester. Disputes should be referred to the appropriate dean.
