Special Covid-19 Content Delivery and Accessibility:
I plan to teach using a blend of synchronous and asynchronous delivery via Zoom and D2L,
where it should make no effective and essential difference whether at any time you are F2F or remote.
I intend to record all lectures.  And, most materials will be available through D2L.
Student submissions of quizzes, assignments, notes, etc. will be via a D2L dropbox.
This plan should maximize flexibility for both you and me to adapt to whatever factors change progressively
or suddenly for either you or me.
You will never be expected to be F2F in our classroom.
