<h2> Introduction:</h2>
This lab provides experience with event-controlled AND counter-controlled
loops, the non-associativity of floating point addition, and two different
floating point sizes.
<h2> Lab Assignment:</h2>

<h4> Problem Motivation and Definition:</h4>

<P> A harmonic series is the sum of a sequence of terms, where the terms are
the reciprocals of all of the set of positive integers:
1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 + ...

<P> In mathematical theory, using infinite precision arithmetic, the infinite
sum of a harmonic series is infinite (but it grows as slowly as a log
function), and the order in which you sum the terms is irrelevant.

<P> In computing practice, using finite precision arithmetic, the order in
which we sum the terms affects the accuracy.  Most of the significance
of a small number is lost when it is added to a large number.  When the
ratio of the larger number to the smaller number becomes large enough,
the sum will be identical to the larger number.  This principle causes
the forward sum (sum from largest to smallest terms) to be finite, and
also to be less accurate, than the backward sum (sum from smallest to
largest terms) of the same number of terms.  The precision of your floating
point numbers also affects the accuracy and ultimate sum.

<P> To illustrate this, your program will have four separate loops: forward
and backward sums using <B> float </B> precision, and also forward and
backward sums using <B> double </B> precision.

<P> Because we don't know in advance the point at which the terms in the
forward sum will cease contributing to the partial sum, we need to use
an event-controlled loop.  When the sum stops changing, we exit the loop,
and subtract one from the number of terms we added.

<P> Now we can use the number of terms from the first loop to write
counter-controlled loops for the other three sums.

<P> We then compare the three other sums with the <B> double </B> backward sum.

<P> We will also then compare the <B> double </B> backward sum with a formula
computed value for the sum:

<P> H(n) = log(n) + Eulers + 1/(2 n) - 1/(12 n^2) + 1/(120 n^4)

<P> where Eulers is a const double = 0.577215664901533
