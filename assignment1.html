Programming Assignment 1</h2></center>

<div ALIGN=right>
<h3>
Due Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2002</h3></div>

<h3>
Objective</h3>
This assignment is to provide you with experience analyzing a problem and
performing the prescribed sequence of steps to develop an algorithm for
its solution.
<h3>
Problem</h3>

<h4>
Design a program to abstractly model a vending machine.</h4>
You will provide (and turn in):
<li>
A set of clarifying questions with corresponding answers to precisely define,
specify, and constrain your problem;</li>

<li>
A structure chart exhibiting the functional relationships and hierarchies
inherent in your design;</li>

<li>
A pseudocode algorithm&nbsp; to&nbsp; model the functioning of the vending
machine.</li>

<li>
A walk-through of your algorithm with an instance of test data that exhibits
the working of your vending machine.</li>

<p><br>Each page you turn in will be <u>neat</u>, <u>bound </u>with the
other pages, and exhibit&nbsp; your <u>name</u>, <u>course</u>, <u>section</u>,
and <u>date</u>.
<h5>
Specification hints</h5>
I suggest you use the following specifications in your design:
<li>
2 products to be vended [output] (can have different prices)</li>

<li>
coin slot [input](specify accepted coins)</li>

<li>
selection buttons for each product [input]</li>

<li>
selection button for change [input] (releases remaining balance back to
the customer)</li>

<li>
an informational display [output] (it will print a message to the customer)</li>

<li>
sample questions:</li>

<blockquote>
<li>
if there are limits, what are they and what happens when you try to exceed
them, e.g. running out of a product. or pressing a vending button before
there's a sufficient balance to vend.</li>

<li>
will you make change (refund balance) after a product has been vended,
or only after the "change" button has been pushed?</li>
</blockquote>

<h5>
Extra Credit</h5>
Provide the pseudocode for detailing exactly how the balance will be refunded
as change using the fewest possible (minimum number of) coins.
