REQUIRED TEXT:	* A Structured Programming Approach Using C++,
		    by Forouzan & Gilbert, Brooks/Cole, 2000.
		* A Practical Guide to the UNIX System,
                    by Mark G. Sobell, Benjamin/Cummings, 1995.
OBJECTIVES:
    This course uses the high-level computer programming language, C++,
    and appropriate mathematical concepts to introduce the fundamentals
    of computer science, algorithm design, problem solving, and elementary
    data structures and algorithms.

TOPICS:
    * A basic working knowledge of the UNIX operating system, including the
      use of files and an editor.
    * The logical structure of a digital computer.
    * An introduction to algorithms.
    * An introduction and brief survey of programming languages.
    * Entering, editing, compiling, debugging, and running C++ programs.
    * Program development and top-down design.
    * Reading and writing data: standard input and standard output.
    * Expressions and their evaluation; statements.
    * Subprograms and program modularity: functions, parameter passing,
      and default arguments; the scope of variables and functions.
    * Boolean expressions, selection statements, and DeMorgan's law.
    * Iteration (looping).
    * Reading and writing text files.
    * Time complexity and algorithm analysis.
    * Pointers and their manipulation; Passing arrays as parameters;
      memory allocation and de-allocation.
    * Enumerated types.

PREREQUISITES:
    All students in this class should have passed the prerequisite course
    as listed in the course description, MATH 112 {College Algebra}, or
    higher.  If you are taking this course for your major, you should at least
    be enrolled in MATH 221 {Calculus & Analytical Geometry I} (although it
    is preferable to have completed MATH 221 prior to undertaking CSCI 201).

CLASS ACCOUNTS:
    All submitted work for this class must be done using the account assigned
    for this class.

CLOSED LABS:
    We will spend time in the lab on Tuesday every week.  These labs cannot be
    made up.

ASSIGNMENTS:
    In addition to the projects assigned during the closed labs, you will
    also be expected to complete programming projects on your own outside
    of class time.  The programs are due at the beginning of class on the
    due date.  No allowance will be made for computer down time, so plan
    ahead.  Late work will not be accepted.

ACADEMIC HONESTY:
    You are expected to do your own homework.  If you copy someone else's
    work or allow someone else to copy your work, you are being academically
    dishonest and will be subject to severe disciplinary action which may
    include any or all of: no credit for the work in question, a failing grade
    for the course, notification to the university that you have violated your
    Code of Conduct.

ATTENDANCE & CONDUCT:
    You are responsible for knowing what happens at each class meeting.
    Do not engage in disruptive or distracting activities. (this includes
    allowing your cell ring audibly during class)

EXAMS:
    There will be two 45 minute exams and a comprehensive final exam.
    Make-up exams will be given in only in extreme (or university
    sanctioned) circumstances and only with prior notice.

GRADING:
	Your grade will be determined by the contributions of your scores
	on assignments,  a midterm and a final exam.  Makeup of tests,
	quizzes, and exams are by prior arrangement only.

APPROXIMATE POINTS:
	Assignments		25%
	Hour Exams		30%
	Final Exam		35%
	Labs:			10%

FINAL EXAM: Monday, December 15 7:30AM - 10:00AM in EB-A226.

CAVEAT:
    I reserve the right to amend the contents of this syllabus with
    notification.
