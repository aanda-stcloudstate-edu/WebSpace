CLASS TIME AND LOCATION:
    Sec 1: TH  15:30 -  16:45 in ECC-108

REQUIRED TEXTS: * Accuracy and Stability of Numerical Algorithms,
                  Nicholas J. Higham, SIAM,
                  2nd ed, 2002.
                * Software Optimization for High Performance Computing,
                  Kevin R. Wadleigh and Isom L. Crawford, Prentice Hall PTR,
                  1st ed, 2000.
COURSE DESCRIPTION:
Numerical computation essentially consists of the study, and implementation
in software on some architecture, of those algorithms which compute via finite
precision (usually floating point) arithmetic.
   The high-performance qualification in the course title incorporates
the issues of relative efficiency and accuracy in comparing those algorithms
and software.
High-Performance computing requires an understanding of the influence of
computer hardware, architecture, and system software resources on efficiency
and accuracy.



COURSE GOALS:
   I would hope students who complete this course would:
gain an understanding of how essential computer science theory and
practice is in supporting the computational solution of science and
engineering problems; discover how mathematically identical
algorithms can exhibit such computationally different behaviors;
enjoy a course which ties together and exhibits the relevance of a
substantial amount of computer science theory and practice that they had
been previously exposed to in a more compartmentalized manner.

   My expectation for students who successfully complete the course will be
that they can:
* identify the kind of numerical problem they are to solve;
* find literature and software describing its solution;
* exploit the best existing software for solving their numerical problems;
* program reasonably simple equations stably.
* understand the influence of architecture on performance and software design.

PREREQUISITES:
    Undergraduate or Graduate standing in Computer Science or Computer
    Engineering, a level of programming competence equivalent to CSCI 331,
    and a sufficient exposure to the principles and notation of linear and
    matrix algebra.


ACADEMIC HONESTY:
    You are expected to do your own work.  If you copy someone else's work
    or allow someone else to copy your work, you are being academically
    dishonest and will be subject to severe disciplinary action which may
    include any or all of: no credit for the work in question, a failing grade
    for the course, notification to the university that you have violated your
    Code of Conduct.

ATTENDANCE &amp; CONDUCT:
    You are responsible for knowing what happens at each class meeting.
    Do not engage in disruptive or distracting activities. (this includes
    allowing your cell phone to ring audibly during class)

Course Plan
   The course will be run very much like a seminar; we will all identify
appropriate information and present it to the group.  We will also design
and carry out assignments and projects connected to our discussions and
write and answer exam questions.

GRADING:
Grades will be based on your contribution to developing this course:
participation, quality of proposed assignments and exam questions, and projects.

FINAL EXAM: Tuesday, May 10 15:45AM - 18:15PM in ECC-108.

CAVEAT:
    I reserve the right to amend the contents of this syllabus with
    notification.
