<h1>CSCI 331 - Software Systems Fall 2019</h1>

<h2><u>Sequence Set</u> Group Project</h2> 
<h3>Preliminary Documents Drafts</h3> 

<p>
Prior to commencing coding for the Sequence Set Class assignment, your group will submit a set of preliminary documents which specify clearly
the components of the Sequence Set project and who is responsible for which parts.
</p>


<h2>WHAT TO TURN IN:</h2>

<ul>
    <li><b>Design Document</b> for the <u>Sequence Set Class</u>.<br>
	(Consider using facilities in, e.g. Jgrasp or Doxygen)<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Describe the architecture of:<br>
        (<i>both as objects in memory and as corresponding entities in a file</i>)<br>
        {For entities in files, include and describe all of the non-data overhead}
        <ul>
            <li>the input data file
            <li>the blocked record file
            <li>the index file (maps primary keys to RBNs)
            <li>the header record
            <li>a block containing records
            <li>a record (&amp; its fields)
        </ul>
        <li>Describe the <i>methods</i> of the SS class:
        <ul>
            <li>constructor(s) / destructor (etc. for in-RAM objects)
            <li><code>create</code>
            <li><code>open/load</code> (necessary components of an existing SS {i.e. header record &amp; index file into memory)
            <ul>
                <li>consider optionally running the <code>validate</code> method
            </ul>
            <li><code>close</code>
            <li><code>is_empty</code> (via a flag, can be applied to either file, a block, a record slot in a block, or a field within a record)
            <li><code>search</code> (for a record)
            <li><code>populate</code> (populate the blocked record file from the input data file)
            <ul>
                <li>consider populating to 3/4 capacity as a default parameter<br> (can be changed for testing block merging, splitting, &amp; record redistribution)
            </ul>
            <li><code>insert</code> (a record)
            <li><code>delete</code> (a record)
            <li><code>update</code> (a field of a record)
            <li><code>display_record</code>
            <li><code>diplay_SS</code> (parameterized to display the whole record or a subset of fields)
            <li><code>validate</code> (is your sequence set ordered by primary key?  Can you get to each record via the index file?)
            <li>(...<i>private helper</i> functions/methods)
            <li>(...<i>debug</i> functions/methods) {consider using a static debug flag for the class}
        </ul>
    </ul>
    

    <li> <b>Test Document</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Describe the test driver program
        <ul>
            <li>describe how to use the command line options
        </ul>
        <li>Describe the details and purpose of each running of the test driver program in the test script
        <ul>
            <li>describe the method/functionality that will be tested
            <ul>
                <li>For verifying correct performance of record deletion or insertion, include tests which demonstrate (each of) these effects:
                <ol>
                    <li>no structural change, &amp; the operation is confined to that block 
                    <ul>
                        <li>this <i>may</i> require an update to the index
                        <li>(this will be the norm for larger capacity blocks filled initially to 75%)
                    </ul>
                    <li>no structural change, but there is <u>redistribution</u> operation performed with one of the two logically adjacent blocks
                    <ul>
                        <li>this <i>will</i> require an update to the index
                    </ul>
                    <li>a structural change occurs &mdash; either a <u>merge</u> or a <u>split</u>
                    <ul>
                        <li>this <i>will</i> require an update to the index
                    </ul>
                    <li>how do you handle a failed deletion search?
                </ol>
                <li>(suggestion:) an insertion or a deletion test can have the following sequential structure:
                <ol>
                    <li><code>populate</code>
                    <li>display structure and/or run <code>validate</code>
                    <li>perform insertion or deletion
                    <li>display structure and/or run <code>validate</code>
                </ol>
            </ul>
            <li>Suggested command line structure:
            <ul>
                <li>must have the filename for that subset of the full data set which will be used for initially populating the sequence set file for this test
                <li>can additionally have a list of one or more primary keys, each prefaced with either a delete flag or an insert flag, which will be performed, in sequence, after the SS is populated.
                For insertion, the primary key will be used to provide the full record for that key.
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <li><u>The users manual</u>.<br>
    There should be a section for each of the following:<br>

    <ul>
        <li>Describe what the SS Class is supposed to do, and what the syntax is to use its methods.
        <li>Describe the tests that the driver is performing, and what the syntax is for its command line interface.
        <li>Describe the set of tests in the test script.
    </ul>
    
    <li> <b>Scheduling Document</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Who is serving as <i>team leader</i>?
        <li>Create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart">Gantt Chart</a> to indicate the ordering of tasks and that subset of team members responsible for that task<br>
        (some tasks can be performed simultaneously or in any order, other tasks must be completed before other tasks can be completed.<br>  
        There can be significant overlaps.<br>
        <br>
        The Gantt chart implicilty represents a dependency hierarchy )
