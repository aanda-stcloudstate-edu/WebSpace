<h1>CSCI 331 - Software Systems</h1>
<h2>Assignment 3, Program 1</h2>

<h3><span style='font-size:10.5pt'>PROGRAM 1</span></h3> 
<h3>PROJECT COLLABORATION TYPE:  <u>Individual</u>.<BR>
	That means you should do the work on your own. <br>
	(<i>However, you may discuss with others</i>)</h3>

<p>
<h2>THE PROGRAM:</h2>  This is the first and foundational 
installment of the object-oriented programming (OOP) project for this class.
It is modeled after the project described in the text book.
You will need to use the results of this project in subsequent projects so do
this one carefully and design for change since you will certainly want to
change what you do here.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Design a class <b>journal</b>.
    <br>Each object represents a single journal.
    <br>Members should include:
    <ul>
	<li>journal identification key
	<li>journal name
    </ul>

    <li>Design a class <b>article_date</b>.
    <br>Each object represents a single journal article date.
    <br>Members should include:
    <ul>
	<li>month {<i>exploit</i> <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/cpp/EnumerationTypes.asp"><u>enumeration</u></a> <i>here</i>}
	<li>year
    </ul>

    <li>Design a class <b>author</b>.
    <br>Each object represents information about a single person.
    <br>Members should include
    <ul>
	<li>author identification key
	<li>last name
	<li>first name
	<li>middle name (or initial)
    </ul>

    <li>Design a class <b>article</b>.
    <br>Each object represents information about a single article.
    <br>Members should include:
    <ul>
	<li> Mandatory Fields
	<ul>
	    <li>article identification key
	    <li>author ID list
	    <li>count of authors
	    <li>title
	    <li>journal identification key
	    <li>volume
	    <li>number
	    <li>pages
	    <li>count of pages
	    <li>article_date
	</ul>
    </ul>

    <li>Design a class <b>BibList</b>.
    <br>Each object represents a list of articles in a journal.
    <br>Members should include:
    <ul>
	<li>BibList identification key
	<li>list of article ID keys
	<li>count of articles
	<li>initial article_date
	<li>terminal article_date
    </ul>

    <br>For each class, methods should include:

    <ul>
	<li>constructors
	<li>destructors
	<li>assignment (<i>overloaded </i><b><tt>'='</tt></b> <i>operator</i>)
	<li>mutators (<i>allow modification of each respective field</i>)
	<li>accessors (<i>allow change-free access to each respective field</i>)
	<li>dump (<i>for debugging</i>)
	<li><i>any other method you think would be useful</i>
    </ul>
</ol>


<ul>
    <li>Implement your classes and create a list of <u>authors</u>,
    a list of <u>articles</u>, and a <u>BibList</u>.
    <ul>
	<li>This will be used in subsequent programming projects.
    </ul>
    <li>Add methods to the classes to read field values from an input stream<br>
    and to write the fields of an object to an output stream nicely formatted.<br>
    <li>You may also want to be able to prompt a user to enter the field values.<br>
    <li>There should be a method to sort lists and another to determine whether a list is sorted (<i>a good application for a Boolean flag</i>)<br>
    <li>Use the C++ stream operations to implement these methods.<br>
    <li>Use only C++ STL strings and STL vectors (<i>not C arrya and character arrays</i>) to implement these methods.<br>
    <li>Write a driver program to verify that the class along with its
    methods has been correctly implemented.<br>
    <li>Use <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen">Doxygen</a> to help document your code.
    <li>Use <u>makefiles</u> to automate your compilation and testing.
</ul>

<p>
<h2>WHAT TO SUBMIT:</h2>
<ol>
    <li><u>The test document </u>.<br>
    <li> <u>The test data used</u>,<br>
    along with an <u>explanation of why you chose it</u>,<br>
    and <u>what were the results of the tests</u>.<br>
    This should include a script file from the test runs.<br>
    Each test should be annotated on the script file.<br>
    (<font color="teal">25% of your grade</font>)

    <li><u>The source file of the program</u>.<br>
    Leave a copy of the source file in your account.<br>
    The source code should be documented liberally using good style.<br>
    (<font color="teal">45% of your grade</font>)

    <li><u>The design document</u>.<br>
    This should be created using <i>Doxygen</i> and have a section for each of the following:<br>
    (<font color="teal">25% of your grade</font>)
    <ol type=a>
	<li>The name of the program.
	<li>What the program is supposed to do.
	<li>Where it is located on the computer. (The <tt>csci</tt> system path)<br>
	(<tt>pwd</tt> will answer this for you)
	<li>How to make/compile the program. (using a makefile)
	<li>How to run the program.
	<li>A sample execution of the program.<br>
	(this is not the test data)
	<li>What the known errors in the program are.
	<li>A short paragraph describing what you learned from this assignment.
    </ol>
	<li>Try to answer the questions:
	<br>(<font color="teal">5% of your grade</font>)
    <ul>
	<li>How much time did you spend on the program?
	<li>Did you plan well before going to the computer?
	<li>Did you test the program completely? 
	<li>Did you learn anything new about the language?
    </ul>
</ol>
