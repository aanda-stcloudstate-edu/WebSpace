<h1>CSCI 331 - Software Systems Fall 2019</h1>

<h2><u>B+ Tree</u> Group Project</h2> 

<p>
This project is the second in a two-component, two-phase, project.
<h3>Objective</h3>
Generate a <u>B+tree</u> as a file composed of (doubly) linked blocks of fixed-sized records comprising fixed-sized fields.<br>
(based on <i>Programming Exercises</i> 10.19 in the Folk textbook).
<br><br>
You will design your B+tree using the specifications in Folk Section 9.10,
with the sequence set of pages/blocks (containing records) being doubly linked,
as you produced in the Sequence Set project.
<br>
The B-Tree pages/blocks, growing up from the sequence set leaves,
will contain only lists of ordered pairs of the largest keys of each child page/block with the relative block number of that child, sorted by key.
<br>
The B-tree index (growing up from the sequence set leaves) will <i>replace</i> the simple index file (from the previous project),
with the crucial factors being that the B-tree index will use the <i>same</i> page/block size as the sequence set,
and the B-tree index pages/blocks will be <i>interleaved</i> with the sequence set pages/blocks in the <i>same</i> file.
<br><br>
Teams will each implement a dynamic <b>B+tree Class</b> that generates and uses a paged/blocked B+tree file.
<br><br>
The same US Postal Code data file will be used (from the previous project),
however, you should test the flexibility of your design by successfully processing a column-reordered version of the data file, and one with fewer fields.
<br><br>
Consider developing and testing, <i>first</i>, a <u>static</u> version of the B+tree Class which can generate a B+tree file,
then verify that the file can be used as a sequence set and as an index to access any record through the <u>root</u> via the record's primary key.
<br>
Then add <i>dynamic</i> functionality to be able to insert and delete records.
<br><br>
</p>
You should have a method of printing (dumping) the contents and shape of your B-tree file
so that you can determine whether your implementations for building, insertion and
deletion are functioning properly. 
This dump should be sufficiently readable to help facilitate debugging.

Write a test driver that demonstrates that your B+tree Class and file work properly and robustly.<br>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3>Specifications for a program which uses the B+tree Class:</h3>
The application program will iterate through the B+tree displaying (<i>neatly</i>) the
Northern<i>most</i>, Southern<i>most</i>, Eastern<i>most</i>, and Western<i>most</i> zip code for a specified state.<br>
{You can verify the results by sorting the Excel source data file <i>first</i> by state, <i>then</i> by longitude or by latitude}<br><br>

Also, the application program, using a different set of command line flags, will display (<i>neatly</i>) the
 <u>State</u> and <u>Place&nbsp;Name</u> for a specified <u>Zip&nbsp;Code</u> (or set of Zip Codes).
<ol>
    <li>Run the test driver program to build the <i>full</i> B+tree file;
	<li>Run the application program specifying the <u>B+tree&nbsp;file</u> and the <u>State</u> on the <u>command&nbsp;line</u>;
    <li>Use the Unix <code>script</code> command to show:
    <ol>
	<li>the building of the Sequence Set file,
	<li>the repeated running of the application program and its output for several states, 
	<li>the repeated running the application program to display the <u>State</u> and <u>Place&nbsp;Name</u> for several <u>Zip&nbsp;Code</u>s.
    </ol>
</ol>

<h2>WHAT TO TURN IN:</h2>

<ol>
    <li><u>A Design Document for the B+tree Class and for its test driver program</u>.<br>

    <li> <u>A Test Document for the B+tree Class</u>,<br>
    Describe each test along with an <u>explanation of why you chose it</u>,<br>
    and <u>what was the result of each test</u>.<br>
    This should include a script file from the test runs.<br>
    Each test should be annotated in the script file. (preceding each test, use <code>%echo "&lt;test description&gt;"</code>)<br>

    <li><u>A User Manual</u>.<br>
    This should describe:<br>
    <ol>
	<li>The name of the class.
	<li>Describe how to use the public methods.
	<li>How to compile the class and program which uses the class. (use a <u>makefile</u>)
	<li>Examples of using the methods.
	<li>How to use the test driver program.
	<li>Note the known errors and deficiencies for the class?
    </ol>
    
    <li><u>Source files</u><br>
	Include:
	<ul>
	    <li>a Doxygen PDF to display the B+tree Class (and subordinate classes), its source code, and its UML class diagrams
	    <li>the <code>.cpp</code> files for the:
	    <ul>
		<li>B+tree Class;
		<li>the test driver program;
		<li>the application program.
	    </ul>
	    <li>the script file that was generated to show the running of the application program.
	    <li>the class' <u>makefile</u> if you used one to compile the class.
	</ul>
