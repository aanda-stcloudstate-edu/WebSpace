<h1>CSCI 331 - Software Systems Spring 2018</h1>

<h2>B+Tree Group Project</h2> 

<p>
Your team has previously implemented <b>Component A</b>:
<h3>Component A</h3>
The generation of a <u>sequence set</u> of <u>records</u>
<br>
<b>Component A</b> lays the foundation for the second team component which implements:
<h3>Component B</h3>
The creation of a <u>B+tree index</u> of that sequence set.<br>
You will implement a B+tree having the following attributes:
<ul>
    <li> all options should be available through the command line
    <li> use a configurable order B+tree 
    <ul>
	<li>consider using a lower order (&lt;=10) for testing and initial debugging
    </ul>
    <li> records will reside in the <u>leaves</u> <i>only</i> in a seqence of
    <u>linked blocks</u>.  Higher order nodes will contain <i>only</i> <u>keys</u>.<br>
    (We are borrowing the idea of linked blocked records from Chapter 10.1 &amp; 10.2, and introduced
    in the first paragraph of p. 401 in Section 9.9, and defined in Section 9.10)
    <ul>
	<li>We can simplify the avail list by using identically-sized blocks for both the sequence set blocks and the tree node blocks.
    </ul>
    <li>Essentially, we are implimenting Programming Exercises 10.19, 10.21, and 10.22, and <i>optionally</i>, 10.20</li>
</ul>
Write a test driver that demonstrates that your B+tree works.<br>
At a minimum your program should be able to (via menu):
<ul>
    <li>open the files of records along with their B+tree indices
    <li>print all the information about a record
    <li>modify fields in any record 
    <li>insert records
    <li>delete records
    <li>verify that the B+Tree file is consistent, but rebuild if inconsistent
    <li>rebuild the B+Tree
    <li>any other useful operations you think of that you can implement and test
</ul>
</p>
You should have a method of printing (<i>dumping</i>) the intermediate contents of the B+tree
so that you can determine whether your implementations for building, insertion and
deletion are functioning properly.  This dump should be sufficiently readable to help
facilitate debugging.

<p>
<h5>Demonstration</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Your group leader will reserve an hour during finals week for your team to collectively make an <i>interactive</i> oral presentation and demonstration of your project to the instructor.</li>
</ol>

<h2>WHAT TO TURN IN:</h2>

<ol>
    <li><u>Design document for the classes</u>.<br>
	(Consider using facilities in, e.g. Jgrasp or Doxygen)
    (<font color="teal">25% of your grade</font>)

    <li> <u>The test data used</u>,<br>
    along with an <u>explanation of why you chose it</u>,<br>
    and <u>what were the results of the tests</u>.<br>
    This should include a script file from the test runs.<br>
    Each test should be annotated on the script file.<br>
    (<font color="teal">25% of your grade</font>)

    <li><u>The source file of the program</u>.<br>
    Also, leave a copy of the source file in your account until the graded
    program is returned to you.<br>
    (<font color="teal">25% of your grade</font>)

    <li><u>The users manual</u>.<br>
    This should be typed and have a section for each of the following:<br>
    (<font color="teal">25% of your grade</font>)
    <ol type=a>
	<li>The name of the program.
	<li>What the program is supposed to do.
	<li>Where it is located on the computer.<br>
	(<tt>pwd</tt> will answer this for you)
	<li>How to compile and run the program. (use a <u>makefile</u>)
	<li>A sample execution of the program.<br>
	(this is not the test data)
	<li>What the known errors in the program are.
    </ol>
    </ul>
    <li>Everyone in the group should turn in their peer evaluations to the instructor separately at the time of the final demonstration.
</ol>
