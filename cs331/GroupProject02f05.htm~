<h3><span style='font-size:10.5pt'>Group Project 2</span></h3> 
<h3>PROJECT COLLABORATION TYPE:  <u>Group</u></h3>

<p>
<h2>THE PROGRAM:</h2>  This project can be considered to be a double project.
<br>
The first part, creating a <u>sorted</u> <u>file</u> of <u>records</u> via
(<i>tournament</i>) merging of <u>replacement selection</u> sorted lists,
will lay the foundation for the second part,
the creation of a <u>B+tree index</u> of that list.
We are going to implement a B+tree with the following attributes:
<ul>
    <li> We will use a reset-able order B+tree (defaulting to 4)
    <li> Our records will reside in the <i>leaves only</i> in a seqence of
    <u>linked blocks</u>.  Higher order nodes will contain <i>only keys</i>.
    (We are borrowing the idea of linked blocked records from Chapter 10)
    <li>When we sort our records we will use replacement selection then merge.
    <li>Our replacement selection algorithm will assume a reset-able value
    for the number of records that can fit in memory (defaulting to 8)
</ul>
Write a program that demonstrates that your B-tree works.<br>
At a minimum your program should be able to:
<ul>
    <li>open the files of records along with their B-tree indices
    <li>print all the information about a person and book for a lending
    <li>print the lending information for a person
    <li>insert records into any file 
    <li>delete records from any file 
    <li>any other useful operations you think of that you can implement and test
</ul>
</p>
You should have a method of printing the intermediate contents of the B+tree
so that you can determine whether your algorithms for building, insertion and
deletion are functioning properly.

<h2>WHAT TO TURN IN:</h2>
Each of the items below should be saved on a CD.
Each team will have available at the due date 2 CDs for the instructor and a
CD for each other team for their evaluation.

<ol>
    <li><u>Design document for the classes</u>.<br>
    This one doesn’t have to be typed but it must be drawn neatly.<br>
    Use only one side of the paper and do not hand in pages
    torn from a spiral notebook unless you cut off the ruffles.<br>
    (<font color="teal">25% of your grade</font>)

    <li> <u>The test data used</u>,<br>
    along with an <u>explanation of why you chose it</u>,<br>
    and <u>what were the results of the tests</u>.<br>
    This should include a script file from the test runs.<br>
    Each test should be annotated on the script file.<br>
    (<font color="teal">25% of your grade</font>)

    <li><u>The source file of the program</u>.<br>
    Also, leave a copy of the source file in your account until the graded
    program is returned to you.<br>
    (<font color="teal">20% of your grade</font>)

    <li><u>The users manual</u>.<br>
    This should be typed and have a section for each of the following:<br>
    (<font color="teal">25% of your grade</font>)
    <ol type=a>
	<li>The name of the program.
	<li>What the program is supposed to do.
	<li>Where it is located on the computer.<br>
	(<tt>pwd</tt> will answer this for you)
	<li>How to compile and run the program. (use a <u>makefile</u>)
	<li>A sample execution of the program.<br>
	(this is not the test data)
	<li>What the known errors in the program are.
    </ol>
    <li>Everyone in the group should do their own paragraph describing
	what you learned from this assignment.  
	<br>(<font color="teal">5% of your grade</font>)
    <ul>
	<li>How much time did you spend on the program?
	<li>Did you plan well before going to the computer?
	<li>Did you test the program completely? 
	<li>Did you learn anything new about the language?
	<li>Did you learn anything new about the way you study or should study?
    </ul>
    <li>As a group, what did you learn to do, and not do, from the peer review
	of other groups projects?
    <li>Everyone in the group should turn in the peer evaluation.
	These should be turned in to the instructor separately.
    <li>The group leader should schedule a 30-minute meeting with me to
	demonstrate the project.  The group leader must also turn in their
	group log, the group member evaluations and the summary of the PSP data.
</ol>
