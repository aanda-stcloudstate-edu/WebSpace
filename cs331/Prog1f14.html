<h1>CSCI 331 - Software Systems - Fall 2014</h1>
<h2>Programming Assignment 1</h2>

<h3><span style='font-size:10.5pt'>PROGRAM 1</span></h3> 
<h3>PROJECT COLLABORATION TYPE:  <u>Individual</u>.<BR>
	That means you should do the work on your own. <br>
	(<i>However, you may discuss this assignment with others</i>)</h3>

<p>
<h2>THE PROGRAM:</h2>  This is the first and foundational 
installment of the object-oriented programming (OOP) project for this class.
It is modeled after the project described in the text book.
You will need to use the results of this project in subsequent projects so do
this one carefully and design for change since you will certainly want to
change what you do here.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Design a class <b>journal</b>.
    <br>Each object represents a single journal or journal container.
    <br>Members should include:
    <ul>
	<li>Data Members
	<ul>
	    <li>journal ID key
	    <li>journal name
	</ul>
	<li>Special Methods
	<ul>
	    <li>Will display a journal's full name given the ID key, and respond appropriately if no such key exists.
	</ul>
    </ul>

    <li>Design a class <b>article_date</b>.
    <br>Each object represents a single journal article date.
    <br>Members should include:
    <ul>
	<li>month {<i>exploit</i> <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/cpp/EnumerationTypes.asp"><u>enumeration</u></a> <i>here</i>}
	<li>year
    </ul>

    <li>Design a class <b>author</b>.
    <br>Each object represents information about a single person or author container.
    <br>Members should include
    <ul>
	<li>Data Members
	<ul>
	    <li>author ID key
	    <li>last name
	    <li>first name
	    <li>middle name (or initial)
	</ul>
	<li>Special Methods
	<ul>
	    <li>Will display an author's full name given the ID key, and respond appropriately if no such key exists.
	</ul>
    </ul>

    <li>Design a class <b>article</b>.
    <br>Each object represents information about a single article or article container.
    <br>Members should include:
    <ul>
	<li>Data Members
	<ul>
	    <li>article ID key
	    <li>author ID key <u>list</u>
	    <li>title
	    <li>journal ID key
	    <li>volume
	    <li>number
	    <li>first page
	    <li>last page
	    <li>article_date
	</ul>
	<li>Special Methods
	<ul>
	    <li>Will display an article's full citation given the ID key, and respond appropriately if no such key exists.
	</ul>
    </ul>

    <li>Design a class <b>BibList</b>.
    <br>Each object represents a list of articles, e.g. those in a journal.
    <br>Members should include:
    <ul>
	<li>Data Members
	<ul>
	    <li>BibList identification key
	    <li>list of article ID keys
	</ul>
	<li>Special Methods
	<ul>
	    <li>count of articles
	    <li>count of authors (don't count duplicates - an author listed in more than one article)
	    <li>output a sorted list of authors, with each author listed only once.  Follow each author's name with the count of articles they appear in.
	    <li>earliest article_date
	    <li>latest article_date
	</ul>
    </ul>

    <br>For each class, methods should include:

    <ul>
	<li>constructors
	<li>destructors
	<li>assignment (<i>overloaded </i><b><tt>'='</tt></b> <i>operator</i>)
	<li>mutators (<i>allow modification of each respective field</i>)
	<li>accessors (<i>allow change-free access to each respective field</i>)
	<li>dump (<i>for debugging</i>)
	<li><i>any other methods you think would be useful</i>
    </ul>
</ol>


<ul>
    <li>Implement your classes and create a list of <u>authors</u>,
    a list of <u>articles</u>, and a <u>BibList</u>.
    <ul>
	<li>This will be used in subsequent programming projects.
    </ul>
    <li>Add methods to the classes to read field values from an input stream and to write the fields of an object to an output stream nicely formatted.
    <li>You may also want create a function which will prompt a user for all of the field values.
    <li>Use the C++ stream operations to implement these methods.<br>
    <li>Use only C++ STL strings and STL vectors (<i>not C array and character arrays</i>), or other STL containers, to implement these methods.<br>
    <li>Write a driver program to verify that the class along with its methods has been correctly implemented.<br>
    <li>Use <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen">Doxygen</a> to help document your code.
    <li>Use <u>makefiles</u> to automate your compilation and testing on <tt>CSCI2</tt> .
</ul>

<p>
<h2>WHAT TO SUBMIT:</h2>
<ol>
    <li><u>The test document </u>.<br>
    <li> <u>The test data used</u>,<br>
    along with an <u>explanation of why you chose it</u>,<br>
    and <u>what were the results of the tests</u>.<br>
    This should include a script file from the test runs.<br>
    Each test should be annotated on the script file.<br>
    (<font color="teal">25% of your grade</font>)

    <li><u>The source file of the program</u>.<br>
    Leave a copy of the source file in your account.<br>
    The source code should be documented liberally using good style.<br>
    (<font color="teal">45% of your grade</font>)

    <li><u>The design document</u>.<br>
    This should be created using <i>Doxygen</i> and have a section for each of the following:<br>
    (<font color="teal">25% of your grade</font>)
    <ol type=a>
	<li>The name of the program.
	<li>What the program is supposed to do.
	<li>Where it is located on the computer. (The <tt>CSCI2</tt> system path)<br>
	(<tt>pwd</tt> will answer this for you)
	<li>How to make/compile the program. (using a makefile)
	<li>How to run the program.
	<li>A sample execution of the program.<br>
	(this is not the test data)
	<li>What the known errors in the program are.
	<li>A short paragraph describing what you learned from this assignment.
    </ol>
	<li>Try to answer the questions:
	<br>(<font color="teal">5% of your grade</font>)
    <ul>
	<li>How much time did you spend on the program?
	<li>Did you plan well before going to the computer?
	<li>Did you test the program completely? 
	<li>Did you learn anything new about the language?
    </ul>
</ol>
