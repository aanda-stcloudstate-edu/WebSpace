<h3><span style='font-size:10.5pt'>First Group Project</span></h3> 
<h3>PROJECT COLLABORATION TYPE:  <u>Group</u></h3>

<p>
<h2>THE PROGRAM:</h2>  This project is the first in a two phase project.
<br>
One component of your team will implement
<h3>Component A</h3>
the creation of a <u>sorted</u> <u>file</u> of <u>records</u> via <i>k</i>-way
(<i>tournament</i>) merging of <u>replacement selection</u> sorted lists.<br>
<ul>
    <li>This method should work with at least the following record types:
    <ul>
	<li>random integer valued (a <i>large</i> number of records)
	<li>random string valued (a <i>medium</i> number of records)
	<li>A record type from each of the four classes from the 1st programming assignment
    </ul>
    <li>You should provide a <i>comparison method</i> for each record type. 
    <li>When we sort our records we will use replacement selection <i>then</i> merge.</li>
    <li>Our replacement selection algorithm will assume a reset-able value
    for the number of records that can fit in memory (defaulting to 8)
    <li>The number of entries in the <i>k</i>-way tournament sort (<i>k</i>) will be the number of runs.
    <li>Write the following statistics to a log file:</li>
    <ol>
	<li>an identification of which file the (input) unsorted records are from,</li>
	<li>an identification of which file the (output) sorted records are placed in,</li>
	<li>the number of records that can fit in memory,</li>
	<li>the number of records,</li>
	<li>the number of runs,</li>
	<li>the smallest, largest and arithmetic mean number or records in all of the runs,</li>
	<li>the height of the tournament tree for the merge</li>
    </ol>
    <li>A sorted file of records will be generated for each of our categories of record.</li>
    <li>Write a program that demonstrates that your file sorter works for a reasonable set
	of numbers of records in memory and <i>k</i>'s for the <i>k</i>-ary heap trees.</li>
</ul>
<b>Component A</b> will lay the foundation for the second team component which will implement a B+Tree.

<h2>WHAT TO TURN IN:</h2>
Each of the items below should be saved on a CD.
Each team will have available at the due date a CD for the instructor and a CD for the other team.

<ol>
    <li><u>Design document for the classes</u>.<br>
    (<font color="teal">25% of your grade</font>)

    <li> <u>The test data used</u>,<br>
    along with an <u>explanation of why you chose it</u>,<br>
    and <u>what were the results of the tests</u>.<br>
    This should include a script file from the test runs.<br>
    Each test should be annotated on the script file.<br>
    (<font color="teal">25% of your grade</font>)

    <li><u>The source file of the program</u>.<br>
    Also, leave a copy of the source file in your account until the graded
    program is returned to you.<br>
    (<font color="teal">20% of your grade</font>)

    <li><u>The users manual</u>.<br>
    This should be typed and have a section for each of the following:<br>
    (<font color="teal">25% of your grade</font>)
    <ol type=a>
	<li>The name of the program.
	<li>What the program is supposed to do.
	<li>Where it is located on the computer.<br>
	(<tt>pwd</tt> will answer this for you)
	<li>How to compile and run the program. (use a <u>makefile</u>)
	<li>A sample execution of the program.<br>
	(this is not the test data)
	<li>What the known errors in the program are.
    </ol>
    <li>Everyone in the group should do their own paragraph describing
	what you learned from this assignment.  
	<br>(<font color="teal">5% of your grade</font>)
    <ul>
	<li>How much time did you spend on the program?
	<li>Did you plan well before going to the computer?
	<li>Did you test the program completely? 
	<li>Did you learn anything new about the language?
	<li>Did you learn anything new about the way you study or should study?
    </ul>
    <li>As a group, what did you learn to do, and not do, from the peer review
	of other groups projects?
    <li>Everyone in the group should turn in the peer evaluation.
	These should be turned in to the instructor separately.
    <li>The group leader should schedule a 15-minute meeting with me to
	demonstrate the project.  The group leader must also turn in their
	group log, the group member evaluations and the summary of the PSP data.
</ol>
