<h1>CSCI 331 - Software Systems Fall 2016</h1>

<h2>B+Tree Group Project</h2> 

<p>
Your team has previously implemented <b>Component A</b>:
<h3>Component A</h3>
The generation of a <u>sorted</u> <u>file</u> of <u>records</u> via
merging of <u>replacement selection</u> generated sorted lists.<br>
<b>Component A</b> lays the foundation for the second team component which implements:
<h3>Component B</h3>
The creation of a <u>B+tree index</u> of that list.<br>
You will implement a B+tree having the following attributes:
<ul>
    <li> use a configurable order B+tree (defaulting to a block capacity of 6)
    <li> records will reside in the <i>leaves only</i> in a seqence of
    <u>doubly linked blocks</u>.  Higher order nodes will contain <i>only keys</i>.<br>
    (We are borrowing the idea of linked blocked records from Chapter 10.1 &amp; 10.2)
    <ul>
	<li>A more robust design allows for there to be two block capacities: one for the blocks containing records,
	    and a another capacity for non-leaf blocks containing only keys.
    </ul>
    <li>Essentially, we are implimenting Programming Exercises 10.19, 10.21, and 10.22, and <i>optionally</i>, 10.20</li>
    <li>Records will consist of records comprising at least an integer field and a string field (<i>your choice of order</i>)
</ul>
Write a test driver that demonstrates that your B+tree works.<br>
At a minimum your program should be able to:
<ul>
    <li>open the files of records along with their B+tree indices
    <li>print all the information about a record
    <li>modify fields in any record 
    <li>insert records
    <li>delete records
    <li>verify that the B+Tree file is consistent, but rebuild if inconsistent
    <li>rebuild the B+Tree
    <li>any other useful operations you think of that you can implement and test
</ul>
</p>
You should have a method of printing (dumping) the intermediate contents of the B+tree
so that you can determine whether your implementations for building, insertion and
deletion are functioning properly.

<p>
<h5>Both Team Components</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Work together to on the interface to ensure that each <b>component</b> can work
	seamlessly with the other.</li>
    <li>Reserve an hour during finals week for the team to collectively make an oral
	presentation and demonstration of their project to the professor.</li>
</ol>

<h2>WHAT TO TURN IN:</h2>

<ol>
    <li><u>Design document for the classes</u>.<br>
	(Consider using facilities in, e.g. Jgrasp or Doxygen)
    (<font color="teal">25% of your grade</font>)

    <li> <u>The test data used</u>,<br>
    along with an <u>explanation of why you chose it</u>,<br>
    and <u>what were the results of the tests</u>.<br>
    This should include a script file from the test runs.<br>
    Each test should be annotated on the script file.<br>
    (<font color="teal">25% of your grade</font>)

    <li><u>The source file of the program</u>.<br>
    Also, leave a copy of the source file in your account until the graded
    program is returned to you.<br>
    (<font color="teal">20% of your grade</font>)

    <li><u>The users manual</u>.<br>
    This should be typed and have a section for each of the following:<br>
    (<font color="teal">25% of your grade</font>)
    <ol type=a>
	<li>The name of the program.
	<li>What the program is supposed to do.
	<li>Where it is located on the computer.<br>
	(<tt>pwd</tt> will answer this for you)
	<li>How to compile and run the program. (use a <u>makefile</u>)
	<li>A sample execution of the program.<br>
	(this is not the test data)
	<li>What the known errors in the program are.
    </ol>
    <li>Everyone in the group should do their own paragraph describing
	what you learned from this assignment.  
	<br>(<font color="teal">5% of your grade</font>)
    <ul>
	<li>How much time did you spend on the program?
	<li>Did you plan well before going to the computer?
	<li>Did you test the program completely? 
	<li>Did you learn anything new about the language?
	<li>Did you learn anything new about the way you study or should study?
    </ul>
    <li>As a group, what did you learn to do, and not do, from the peer review
	of other groups projects?
    <li>Everyone in the group should turn in the peer evaluation.
	These should be turned in to the instructor separately.
    <li>The group leader should schedule a 30-minute meeting with me to
	demonstrate the project.  The group leader must also turn in their
	group log, the group member evaluations and the summary of the PSP data.
</ol>
