Mary, 

Yes, please set up a provisional e-commerce site as an option for students.

Thank you for all of the work you’ve put in on this for me.

Maybe you can talk the author into publishing a new edition. ;^)

Subject: CSCI 331 - question about custom book

Dear Professor Anda,

I hope your summer is going well!

We have run into an interesting situation with your bookorder for fall.  I understand that 
the Husky bookstore has located enough used copies of the Folk text to cover the entire 
amount of copies they think they will need for your fall class.  They do not intend to order 
any copies of the custom reprint that you requested.  We understand that the off-campus 
stores will not be ordering the reprint either.

This situation is always a bit tricky because bookstores estimate the number they need, 
but they never know until school begins if their stock is sufficient.

Would you like Pearson to set up an e-commerce site so students can purchase online?  
Then students who want a printed copy could purchase a copy on an individual basis 
from us. 

Please let me know if you would like us to offer this option.

Thanks much!
