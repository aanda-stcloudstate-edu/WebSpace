CLASS TIME AND LOCATION:
    Class: MWF: 15:00 - 15:50 in ECC 115

REQUIRED TEXT:	* File Structures: An Object-Oriented Approach with C++,
                  M.J. Fox, B. Zoellick, G. Riccardi, Addison Wesley Longman,
                  1998.
		* Introduction to the Personal Software Process,r
                  W. S. Humphrey, Addison Wesley, 1997.

COURSE DESCRIPTION:
    Problem solving strategies and concepts applied in the context of issues
    associated with the design and implementation of software systems using
    a combination of current software packages/environments. Subjects
    addressed include file processing, data modeling and mapping to storage
    structures, data base systems, and software design and implementation.

TOPICS (not necessarily in order of coverage):
    * Introduction to software engineering
    * External data structures, files, hashing, 2/3 and b-trees
    * Sequential file processing
    * Sorts and Merges
    * Introduction to database
    * and more

PREREQUISITES:
    I assume that all students in this class have taken the prerequisite
    CSCI and MATH courses, or the equivalent, as listed in the catalog.
    If you have not had these courses you should drop this course until
    you have the prerequisites.  I will not spend time teaching you material
    [Prereq.: 220 or ECE 221; 301]

CLASS ACCOUNTS:
    You will be given an account for use in this class.  All work for this
    class must be done in this account and the account must not be used for
    any other class.  You may not let anyone else use the account unless that
    person is a student in this class and is working on a class project
    with you.

PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENTS HOMEWORK AND IN CLASS WORK:
    There will be 4 to 6 programming assignments.  These must be handed in at
    the beginning of class on the day they are due.  No allowances will be
    made for down time on the computer, so I suggest you begin each assignment
    as soon as you receive it.  Programs not turned in on the Due date will be
    penalized.  A program is late if it is turned in after the beginning of
    class on the due date.

    A program must compile to receive any credit.  Keep in mind that I expect
    all programs to produce correct output given error free input.  Check your
    output before getting the final copy to turn in.  Don't assume that a
    program that produces some output without terminating abnormally is
    correct.  Test your program carefully.  You have not tested your program
    if you have no executed every line of code.

    The grade you get on a program is based on the code, the documentation and
    how well it is tested.  To receive better than a C on a program it must do
    more than produce correct output given correct input.  By this I mean your
    program must be robust, well documented, well tested and well written. 

    Your grade on the group projects will also be based on how well you
    cooperate and participate in the group you are assigned to.

    Missing class on days that we have in-class assignments will result in a
    zero for that assignment.  These assignments cannot be made up.  If you
    have trouble getting to class drop now so that someone else can use the
    spot.

    All homework, documentation and programs must be neat.  Here is how you
    can tell if yours is neat.  All homework is due before class starts on
    the due date and the same rules apply for late homework as for late
    programs. I will not grade homework that is not neat.

    1.	Is it written on only one side of the page?
    2.	Is it on standard sized paper using one-inch margins?
    3.	Are the problems presented in order and numbered?
    4.	Is your name on each page?
    5.	Are the pages stapled together?
    6.	Can I read the work without taking the staples out?
    7.	Are there no ragged edges on the papers?

ACADEMIC HONESTY:
    You are expected to do your own homework.  If you copy someone else's
    work or allow someone else to copy your work, you are being academically
    dishonest and will be subject to severe disciplinary action which may
    include any or all of: no credit for the work in question, a failing grade
    for the course, notification to the university that you have violated your
    Code of Conduct.  Use of recording devices during exams is prohibited.
    If you must quote or paraphrase another source, citation is essential,
    otherwise plagiarism has been committed.  You are expected to be familiar
    with your rights and obligations as outlined in the "Code of Conduct"

STUDYING IN GROUPS:
    I encourage you to study with someone else in the class, but when you
    prepare the final documents to turn in be sure that it is your own words
    and sentences and that your understand it.  If you represent someone
    else’s work as your own or allow someone else to turn your work in as
    theirs you will be turned in for cheating and will be given an F. 

DECORUM: Conduct yourself so as not to distract others. In particular
    * Turn off all cell phones, watch alarms, and similar devices.
    * Do not engage in distracting activities like reading a newspaper
      or sleeping. (some of you snore...)
    * Arrive for class on time, and be ready to begin.
      If you must be late, be quiet.
    * If you are early, sit toward the middle of a row.
    * Do not start packing up before class ends.

ATTENDANCE:
    You are responsible for knowing what happens at each class meeting.
    You should expect to spend a lot of time on this class.  It is not an
    easy class.  If you are having trouble in class I expect to see you in
    my office.  If you don't tell me you are having troubles how do you
    expect me to know?  If you can't come during my office hours, make an
    appointment for another time.

QUIZZES:
    There will be a sequence of quizzes of assigned reading.
EXAMS:
    There will be a small set of intermediate exams and a comprehensive
    final exam.
    Exams will be based on the notes; that is, on the presentations in class.
    Calculators will be neither necessary nor allowed.
    Make-up exams will be given in only in extreme (or university
    sanctioned) circumstances and only with prior notice.

GRADING:
	Your grade will be determined by the contributions of your scores
	on assignments,  quizzes, intermediate and final exams.
	Makeup of tests, quizzes, and exams are by prior arrangement only.

APPROXIMATE POINTS:
	Assignments		30%
	Quizzes 		05%
	Hour Exams		40%
	Final Exam		25%

FINAL EXAM: Monday, December 20 13:00 - 15:30 in ECC 115.

CAVEAT:
    I reserve the right to amend the contents of this syllabus with
    notification.
