CSCI 331, Spring 2021, Final Review Topics

(Ignore discussion of <u>tapes</u> in all chapters)

All topics covered by the midterm exam, and: 

* Linear Sorts
    details &amp; criteria (use primarily for which special data conditions?)
    * bucket
    * counting
    * radix

* Command line processing &amp; makefiles

* Robust bisection formula {e.g. [L + (R - L)/2] }
    * won't overflow
    * L &amp; R can be pointers to a type
