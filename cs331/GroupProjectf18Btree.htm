<h1>CSCI 331 - Software Systems Fall 2018</h1>

<h2>B+Tree Group Project</h2> 

<p>
<h2>Data:</h2>
Our data set uses a header record to informs the B+tree regarding how the B+tree program can process the records and their fields.<br>
I.e. our data tells the program how to read it the data.
<ul>
    <li> Your data set will be:
    <ul>
	<li> From this <a href="http://web.stcloudstate.edu/aanda/cs331/w18/us_postal_codes.xlsx">XLSX file</a> which
	    can be saved as this <a href="http://web.stcloudstate.edu/aanda/cs331/w18/us_postal_codes.txt">TXT file</a>
	    as <b>fixed-size</b> fields and records.
	<li>Your records will be sorted by your primary key field (zip code).
    </ul>
    <ul>
	<li>Use this data to generate an input data file having the following characteristics:
	<ul>
	    <li>A header file followed by the fixed-length records containing fixed length fields.
	    <li>The header record will contain the following information:
	    <ul>
		<li>size: header
		<li>flag: insert (* see below)
		<li>count: records
		<li>size: record
		<li>count: fields per record
		<li>list: size: field
		<li>list: text: field labels
		<li>ordinal: sort field<br>(-1 indicates that the data is unsorted)
		<li>text: what is the data, and where did it come from?
	    </ul>
	</ul>
    </ul>
</ul>
If the insert flag is false, then the data should consist of a set of keys of records to <u>delete</u>.<br>
A delete data file should be used for testing only.
Specify a simpler header record in this case. <br><br>

Consider how you might specify a testing data file that can mix records to be deleted with those to be inserted.

</p>


<h2>Implement a B+tree having the following attributes:</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Essentially, we are implimenting Programming Exercises 10.19, 10.21, and 10.22.</li>
    <li> generate and use a configurable-order B+tree (defaulting to a block capacity of 4 records)
    <li> records will reside in the <u>leaves</u> <i>only</i> in a seqence of singly or doubly <u>linked blocks</u>.
	(We are borrowing the idea of linked blocked records from Chapter 10.1 &amp; 10.2, and introduced
	in the first paragraph of p. 401 in Section 9.9, and defined in Section 9.10)
    <li> higher order nodes will contain <i>only</i> <u>keys</u>.<br>
    <li> each right-most key in a block will be promoted to it's parent unless the block is the index set root.
    <li> B+tree file:
    <ul>
	<li>All blocks will be the same (<i>fixed</i>) size [so they may be pointed to via their <b>RBN</b> and potentially go to the same (<i>single</i>) avail list]
	<li>There will be two block capacities: one for the (<i>leaf-level</i>) blocks containing records,
	    and a another (<i>larger</i>) capacity for non-leaf-level blocks containing keys only (consider this the <i>order</i>).
	<li>Header Record components: (import information from data file header)
	<ul>
	    <li>size: header
	    <li>size: block
	    <li>count: total blocks
	    <li>count: index set blocks
	    <li>count: sequence set blocks
	    <li>count: avail list blocks
	    <li>count: capacity: records per sequence set block
	    <li>count: capacity: keys per index set block
	    <li>count: index set levels<br>(<i>optional</i>)
	    <li>RBN: root
	    <li>RBN: sequence set
	    <li>RBN: avail list
	    <li>count: records
	    <li>size: record
	    <li>count: fields per record
	    <li>list: size: field
	    <li>list: text: field labels
	    <li>ordinal: sort field
	    <li>text: what is the data, and where did it come from?
	    <li>time: generated
	    <li>time: last modified
	</ul>
	<li>Sequence Set block components:
	<ul>
	    <li>count: records
	    <li>RBN: successor pointer<br>
	    <li>RBN: predecessor pointer<br>(<i>optional</i> - useful for splitting, merging, &amp; redistribution)
	    <li>RBN: parent pointer<br>(becomes avail list successor if count==0)
	    <li>list: records
	</ul>
	    <li>Index Set block components:
	<ul>
	    <li>count: key/RBN pairs
	    <li>list: key/RBN pairs<br>(could also be two lists respectively)
	    <li>RBN: parent pointer<br>(becomes avail list successor if count==0)
	</ul>
    </ul>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Command Line</h3>
<p>
The command line flags and options should include:
<ul>
    <li>B+tree file name
    <ul>
	<li>if exists, <code>open</code>
	<li>else, <code>create</code>
    </ul>
    <li>data file name
    <ul>
	<li>if the B+tree file exists, add records after <code>open</code><br>(useful for testing &amp; debugging)
	<li>else, use to <code>create</code>
    </ul>
    <li>data file insert/delete flag
    <ul>
	<li>if flag=="I", data file consists of records to be added
	<li>if flag=="D", data file consists of sort keys of records to be deleted
    </ul>
    <li>block size (bytes) <b>OR</b> index set order <b>OR</b> sequence set order <br>(others will be derived)
    <li>fill percentage [50% - 100%] (default to 75%)
    <li>batch flag
    <ul>
	<li>if exists, process data files,<br>then <code>exit</code>
	<li>else, process data files (if any),<br>then open interactive <code>menu</code>
    </ul>
    <li>verbose flag<br>(displays additional information - useful for generating test logs)
    <li>debug flag<br>(displays additional information used for debugging)
    <li>sequence set iteration flag<br>(send, in order, every record to standard output)
    <ul>
	<li>determine how you will represent the fields and records. <br>(what would Unix <code>sort</code> expect?)
    </ul>
    <li>consistency check flag
    <ul>
	<li> the <i>consistency check</i> determines:
	<ol>
	    <li>that every record in the sequence set can be accessed by iterating through the sequence set
		and they are in order WRT the sort key;
	    <li>and for each record encountered in the iteration through the sequence set, that record can be accessed
		by its sort key through the index set (via the root).
	    <li>Note: If the consistency check fails, display/log as much information as possible regarding where and why it failed.
	</ol>
	<li>if the B+tree file exists, run the consistency check after opening and after processing the input if any
	<li>else run the consistency check after processing the input to create the B+tree file.
    </ul>
</ul>
Note: if the command line is empty, print the command line menu
</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>
Use a shell script to perform as a test driver which demonstrates that your B+tree works correctly.<br>
Each line of the shell script should call the B+tree program with differing command line entries and file redirection targets.
At a minimum your program should be able to:
<ul>
    <li>create a B+tree <i>file</i> from a sorted (by primary key) input file.
    <li>open an existing B+tree file then process the data file.
    <li>run a consistency check
    <li>create or open an existing B+tree file, then open an interactive menu
    <li>display (<i>readably</i>) all the fields of a record<br>(specified by sort key)
    <li>display (<i>optionally</i>) a specific field of a record<br>(specified by sort key)
    <li>modify fields in any record 
    <li>insert records
    <li>delete records<br>(by sort key)
    <li>iterate through the sequence set writing the records to a specified file name or to standard output
    <li>dump the structure of the tree (see below)
    <li>any other useful operations you think of that you can implement and test
    <ul>
	<li>e.g. display the number of records, avail blocks, index set blocks, sequence set blocks, and fill statistics
    </ul>
</ul>
You should have a method of displaying (<b>dump</b>ing) the contents of the B+tree
to assist you in determining whether your implementations for building, insertion and
deletion are functioning properly.  This dump should be readable and clearly display the B+tree's vertical
and horizontal structure.
</p>

<p>
Be sure that your testing exercises all of the boundary cases you can think of.<br>
Many of your data sets can be just large enough to demonstrate that case in a non-trivial context.<br>
Show that your tests pass for various block sizes and numbers of records.<br>
Consider as a final large test, processing roughly half of the data records in sorted order,
followed by inserting the other half in random order.
</p>

<p>
<h3>Demo</h3>
<p>
<ol>
    <li>Reserve an hour during finals week for the team to collectively make an oral
	presentation and demonstration of their project to the professor.</li>
</ol>
