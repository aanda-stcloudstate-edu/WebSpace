COURSE DESCRIPTION: (same as for CSCI 331)
    Problem solving strategies and concepts applied in the context of issues
    associated with the design and implementation of software systems using
    a combination of current software packages/environments. Subjects
    addressed include file processing, data modeling and mapping to storage
    structures, data base systems, and software design and implementation.

STUDENT LEARNING GOALS:
    1. gain knowledge updating sequential files as related to data base systems.
    2. gain knowledge about programs and software systems involving trees, blocking/deblocking, sort/merge, updating sequential files, and b-trees.


II Student Outcomes (Sos) for the Computer Science Program:
    Students will be able to:
	1. apply structured principles and good practices to the task of developing software systems.
	4. communicate both technical and non-technical aspects of their work in formal and informal situations.
	5. apply formal methods to the process of constructing a system and an appreciation of the need to study and develop such methods.
	7. analyze various aspects of the process used when designing a system and employ established frameworks to evaluate the completed work.

TOPICS (not necessarily in order of coverage):
    * Sequential file processing
    * Indexed Files
    * Hashed Files
    * Tree Structured Files
    * Secondary storage media
    * Introduction to database
    * Software Design Processes and Principles
    * Software Development Processes and Principles
    * and more...
    * (I will expect students to learn the complexities {bigO} of the
        operations on the data structures we discuss and to be able
        to select, based on those complexities, the most appropriate ADT
        considering the nature of the data and how it will be accessed.)

PREREQUISITES:
    [Prereq.: CSCI 591 or equivalent (A course in data structures using C++)]
    We also assume that you have an operational facility with Unix, hardware, and OS theory.
    We do not have time for an extensive recapitulation of topics covered in the prerequisite courses.



ACADEMIC HONESTY:
    You are expected to do your own homework.  If you copy someone else's
    work or allow someone else to copy your work, you are being academically
    dishonest and will be subject to severe disciplinary action which may
    include any or all of: no credit for the work in question, a failing grade
    for the course, notification to the university that you have violated your
    Code of Conduct.  Use of recording devices during exams is prohibited.
    If you must quote or paraphrase another source, citation is essential,
    otherwise plagiarism has been committed.  You are expected to be familiar
    with your rights and obligations as outlined in the &quot;Code of Conduct&quot;
    [<A HREF="http://www.stcloudstate.edu/studenthandbook/documents/2013_14_codeofconduct.pdf">http://www.stcloudstate.edu/studenthandbook/documents/2013_14_codeofconduct.pdf</A>]  See also:

STUDYING IN GROUPS:
    I encourage you to study with someone else in the class, but when you
    prepare the final documents to turn in be sure that it is your own work and that you understand it.  
	If you represent someone else's work as your own (without citing them as a source), or allow someone else to turn your work in as
    theirs (without citing you as a source), you will have committed academic dishonesty and will receive an F.

DECORUM: Conduct yourself so as not to distract others. In particular
    * Silence all cell phones, watch alarms, and similar devices.
    * Do not engage in distracting activities like reading a newspaper
      or sleeping. [ the snoring can be so distracting... :^) ]
    * Arrive for class on time, and be ready to begin.
      If you must be late, be quiet.
    * If you are early, sit toward the middle of a row.
    * Do not start packing up before class ends.

ATTENDANCE:
    You are responsible for knowing what happens at each class meeting.

EXAMS:
    * There will be a midterm exam and a <b>comprehensive</b> final exam.
    * Exams will be based on the notes; that is, on the presentations in class
		as well as on the assigned readings and assignments.
    * Calculators will be neither necessary nor allowed.
    * For each exam, a new review sheet (8.5"x11' front &amp; back) will be allowed;
		** Make a prior photocopy of your review sheet as it will be collected with the exam.
		** Two review sheets will be allowed on the final exam.
		** Only material from lecture notes (slides and written in lecture), instructor provided supplements,
			or the course textbooks are allowed on each review sheet.
		** Each review sheet must be a unique hand-written original copy.
		** Any answers to questions from exams for this course given in previous semesters which appear on your
			review sheet are considered to be examples of academic dishonesty. 
	* Make-up exams will be given in only in extreme (or university sanctioned) circumstances and only with prior notification to the instructor.

GRADING:
        Your grade will be determined by the contributions of your scores
        on assignments,  quizzes, intermediate and final exams, term papers and their presentations.
        Makeup of tests, quizzes, and exams are by prior arrangement only.
		(Exception handling: If you have received undergraduate credit for CSCI 331 (you were a SCSU CSCI undergrad),
		 instead of taking the exams, you will write and present an additional term paper on a significantly different topic)

APPROXIMATE POINTS:
        Term Paper              30%
		Term Paper presentation 10%
        Midterm Exam            20%
        Final Exam              40%

FINAL EXAM: Monday, December 17, 9:55 - 12:10 in ISELF 109.

CAVEAT:
    I reserve the right to amend the contents of this syllabus with
    notification.
