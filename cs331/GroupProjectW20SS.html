<h1>CSCI 331 - Software Systems Spring 2020</h1>

<h2><u>Sequence Set</u> Group Project</h2> 

<p>
This project is the first in a multi-component, multi-phase, project.
<h3>Objective</h3>
Generate a <u>sequence set</u> as a file composed of (doubly) linked blocks of fixed-sized records comprising fixed-sized fields.<br>
(based on <i>Programming Exercises</i> 10.19 in the Folk textbook)
<h3>Requirements</h3>
Teams will each implement a <b>Sequence Set Class</b> that generates and uses a blocked sequence set file and affilliated (primary key) index file having the following attributes:
<ul>
    <li> Your data set will be:
    <ul>
	<li> From this <a href="http://web.stcloudstate.edu/aanda/cs331/w19/us_postal_codes.xlsx">XLSX file</a> which
	was saved as this <a href="http://web.stcloudstate.edu/aanda/cs331/w19/us_postal_codes_formatted.txt">TXT file</a>
	establishing <b>fixed-size</b> field and record formatting.  And, added for testing a column-reordered version,
	 <a href="http://web.stcloudstate.edu/aanda/cs331/w19/us_postal_codes_column_reorder.txt"><code>us_postal_codes_column_reorder.txt</code></a>.
	 <ul>
	     <li>Your reading of the TXT file must not be "hardwired".  Your method which reads the TXT file will read based on the meta-data in the TXT file's header record.  So, your code must work for both of the above TXT files.
	 </ul>
	<li> For final testing, use about half, or half of any system-dependent size limit you may have, so that you have a reserve for adding records.
	<li>Your records will be sorted by your key field.
    </ul>
    <li> Your sequence set <u>file</u> will start with a <u>header record</u> followed by the <b>fixed-size</b> sequence set blocks.<br>
    (See Figure 10.1 on page 427 of Folk)
    <li> Your header record should include the following components:
    <ul>
        <li>sequence set file type
        <li>header record size
	<li>block size {default to (512B / block)}
        <li>maximum count of records per block
        <ul>
            <li>minimum capacity: 50%
            <li>(<i>for simplicity, require an <u>even</u> number</i>)
        </ul>
        <li>record size
        <li>count of fields per record
        <li>field info triple (tuple) {AoS or SoA}
        <ul>
            <li>name or ID
            <li>size
            <li>type schema 
            <ul>
                (<i><u>format</u> to read or write</i>)
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>indicate field which serves as the primary key
        <li><u>pointer</u> to the block avail-list
        <li><u>pointer</u> to the active sequence set list
        <li>block count
        <li>record count
        <li>stale flag
        <li>Simple Index (10.3)
        <ul>
            <li>file name
            <li>schema information
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li> Each active block should include the following components:
    <ul>
	<li>count of records ( > 0 )
	<li>pointers to preceding &amp; succeeding active blocks
	<li>set of records ordered by key
    </ul>
    <li> Each avail block should include the following components:
    <ul>
	<li>count of records ( == 0 )
	<li>pointer to succeeding avail block
    </ul>
    <li> Your program's </u>command line</u> options should include:
    <ul>
	<li>source file
	<li>destination file
	<li>all other information necessary for the header file
    </ul>
</ul>
At a minimum your program should be able to:
<ul>
    <li>build the sequence set
    <li>given a block pointer and a key:
    <ul>
	<li>display a record
	<li>display a specific field in a record
	<li>modify a field in a record 
	<li>insert records
	<li>delete records
    </ul>
    <li>verify that the sequence set file is consistent
    <li>rebuild the sequence set
    <li>any other useful operations you think of that you can implement and test
</ul>
</p>
You should have a method of printing (dumping) the intermediate contents of the sequence set
so that you can determine whether your implementations for building, insertion and
deletion are functioning properly.  This dump should be sufficiently readable to help
facilitate debugging.

Write a test driver that demonstrates that your sequence set works.<br>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3>Specifications for a program which uses the Sequence Set class:</h3>
The application program will iterate through the sequence set displaying (<i>neatly</i>) the
Northern<i>most</i>, Southern<i>most</i>, Eastern<i>most</i>, and Western<i>most</i> zip code for a specified state.<br>
{You can verify the results by sorting the Excel source data file <i>first</i> by state, <i>then</i> by longitude or by latitude}<br><br>

Also, the application program, using a different set of command line flags, will display (<i>neatly</i>) the
 <u>State</u> and <u>Place&nbsp;Name</u> for a specified <u>Zip&nbsp;Code</u> (or set of Zip Codes).
<ol>
    <li>Run the test driver program to build the <i>full</i> Sequence Set file (and index file);
	<li>Run the application program specifying the <u>Sequence&nbsp;Set&nbsp;file</u> and the <u>State</u> on the <u>command&nbsp;line</u>;
    <li>Use the Unix <code>script</code> command to show:
    <ol>
	<li>the building of the Sequence Set file,
	<li>the repeated running of the application program and its output for several states, 
	<li>the repeated running the application program to display the <u>State</u> and <u>Place&nbsp;Name</u> for several <u>Zip&nbsp;Code</u>s.
    </ol>
</ol>

    Describe each test along with an <u>explanation of why you chose it</u>,<br>
    and <u>what was the result of each test</u>.<br>

    This should describe:<br>
    <ol>
	<li>The name of the class.
	<li>Describe how to use the public methods.

	<li>Examples of using the methods.
	<li>How to use the test driver program.
	<li>Note the known errors and deficiencies for the class?

	Include:
	<ul>
	    <li>a Doxygen PDF to display the Sequence Set Class (and subordinate classes), its source code, and its UML class diagrams
	    <li>the <code>.cpp</code> files for the Sequence Set Class, the test driver program
	    <li>the application program.
	    <li>the script file that was generated to show the running of the application program.
	    <li>the class' <u>makefile</u> if you used one to compile the class.
