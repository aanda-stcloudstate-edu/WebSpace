<h2>THE PROGRAM:</h2>
Implement a two heap, back-to-back, replacement selection algorithm.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Initialize:
    <ul>
	<li>a vector to serve as the replacement selection container.
	<ul>
	    <li>Once the vector size has been set, it should stay that way.
	    <li>The type should be templated.
	</ul>
	<li>a list of sorted lists to receive the sorted output.
	<ul>
	    <li> each new list will be pushed onto the list of sorted lists as a new element
	</ul>
	<li>a first list in the list of sorted lists
	<li>the last element value to be max small.
	<li>a heap direction flag.
	<ul>
	    <li>If TRUE,  the active heap's head is on the left end, and the pending heap's head is on the right end.
	    <li>If FALSE, the active heap's head is on the right end, and the pending heap's head is on the left end.
	</ul>
    </ul>
    <li>While the replacement selection vector is not full:
    <ul>
	<li> heapify a new element
    </ul>
    <li>While there's a new element:
    <ul>
	<li>Pop the smallest element (head) of the current (min) heap, adding it to the current list.
	<li>If the new element is greater than or equal to the last element popped, push it onto the current heap<br>
	<li>If the new element is less than or equal to the last element popped,
	<ul>
	    <li>push it onto the pending heap
	    <li>decrement the current heap size counter, and increment the pending heap size counter.
	    <li>If the current heap size is zero,
	    <ul>
		<li>terminate the current sorted list
		<li>initialize a new sorted list
		<li>toggle the heap direction flag
	    </ul>
	</ul>
	<ul>
	    <li>you should have both current_heap_push() and pending_heap_push() methods, as they'll operate differently.
	</ul>
    <li>Pop the remaining elements into the current and then the possibly next and final list
    </ul>
