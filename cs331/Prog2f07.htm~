<h1>CSCI 331 - Software Systems Fall 2007</h1>

<h2>Project 2</h2>

<h3>
    PROJECT COLLABORATION TYPE: Individual.<br>
    That means you should do the work on your own.<br>
    (<i>However, you may discuss the project with others</i>)
</h3>

<h4>THE PROJECT:</h4>
This is the second installment of our object-oriented programming project.
<p>
Add <u>methods</u> to the <u>classes</u> from program 1 to <b>store</b>
<u>objects</u> as <u>records</u> in <u>files</u> and <b>load</b> objects
from files using the <u><tt>IOBuffer</tt></u> classes described in Chapter 4.
<p>
Write a test program to show that your classes and methods work.
<p>
You will need to add <tt>Pack </tt>and <tt>Unpack </tt>methods to the
classes from <i>Project 1</i> and figure out how to use the
<tt>IOBuffer</tt> classes.
<p>
Use classes <tt>IOBuffer</tt>, <tt>VariableLengthBuffer</tt> and
<tt>DelimitedFieldBuffer</tt> from the buffer class hierarchy.
<p>
As you read the code you will see that the author uses
<u><tt>protected</tt></u> instead of <u><tt>private</tt></u>
for the data members.<br>
<i>All data members should be <u>private</u>.</i><br>
Make <u><tt>protected</tt></u> those methods which
<i>access</i> and <i>mutatate</i> these private data members.
<p>
<b>Notice:</b> that in <tt>person</tt> the author uses arrays of
characters instead of the class string.  Be sure to convert all of the author's
<i>C strings</i> to <i>C++ strings</i>.
<p>
Use STL <u>containers</u> and <u>iterators</u> where applicable.

<h4>Tool Requirements:</h4> 
<ul>
    <li>Take file names from the command line</li>
    <li>Use the <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen">Doxygen</a> documentation system.
    Generate <tt>.pdf</tt> and <tt>.html</tt> documentation</li>
    <li>Use a <a href="http://web.stcloudstate.edu/aanda/cs331.html#Make">Make</a>file.</li>
</ul>

<h4>WHAT TO TURN IN:</h4> 

<ol>
    <li>Design document for the classes.<br>
    (<font color="teal">25% of your grade</font>)

    <li>
    Test data used along with an explanation of why you chose it and the
    results of the tests.<br>
    This should include a script file from the test runs.<br>
    When this gets really long you can make a table showing what you used as
    test data, the expected results, the actual results and what you did
    about them.<br>
    Leave the script file in you account until the program has been graded.<br>
    Each test should be annotated on the script file.<br>
    (<font color="teal">20% of your grade</font>)

    <li><u>The make file for the program</u>.<br>
    (<font color="teal">5% of your grade</font>)

    <li><u>The source file of the program</u>.<br>
    Also, leave a copy of the source and make file(s) in your account until graded.<br>
    (<font color="teal">20% of your grade</font>)

    <li><u>The users manual</u>.<br>
    This should have a section for each of the following:<br>
    (<font color="teal">25% of your grade</font>)
    <ol type=a>
	<li>The name of the program.
	<li>What the program is supposed to do.
	<li>Where it is located on the computer.<br>
	(<tt>pwd</tt> will answer this for you)
	<li>How to run the program.
	<li>A sample execution of the program.<br>
	(this is not the test data)
	<li>What the known errors in the program are.
    </ol>
    <li><i>Extra credit</i>: Use <b>try</b>, <b>throw</b>, <b>catch</b> exception handling in your source.
    <br>(<font color="teal"><i>extra</i> 5% of your grade</font>)
    <li>(<i>submit two days after project submission</i>)<br>
    A short paragraph describing what you learned from this
	assignment.<br>
	Some of these questions can be answered using your <b>PSP</b> data:
	Try to answer the questions:
	<br>(<font color="teal">5% of your grade</font>)
    <ul>
	<li>How much time did you spend on the program?
	<li>Did you plan well before going to the computer?
	<li>Did you test the program completely?
	<li>Did you learn anything new about the language?
	<li>Did your assessment of the set of <u>defects</u> of the previous assignment<br>
	influence your programming, testing, debugging, documentation,<br>
	and set of defects for this assignment?
    </ul>
</ol>
