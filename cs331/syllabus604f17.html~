CLASS TIME AND LOCATION:
    Class: MWF: 11:00 - 11:50 in EB A122

REQUIRED TEXT:  * File Structures: An Object-Oriented Approach with C++,
                  M.J. Folk, B. Zoellick, G. Riccardi, Addison Wesley Longman, 1998.

                  You may buy the text (used) from a campus bookstore (or from a Web-based merchant)
                  or you can follow the following instructions on how to buy the electronic version from the publisher which includes the source code:

RECOMMENDED TEXT * Introduction to the Personal Software Process, W. S. Humphrey, Addison Wesley, 1997.

SUPPLEMENTARY TEXTS * Applied Data Structures with C++, Peter Smith, Jones and Bartlett, 2004.
		    * (your CSCI 591 text, or equivalent text covering data structures in C++)

COURSE DESCRIPTION:
    Problem solving strategies and concepts applied in the context of issues
    associated with the design and implementation of software systems using
    a combination of current software packages/environments. Subjects
    addressed include file processing, data modeling and mapping to storage
    structures, data base systems, and software design and implementation.

STUDENT LEARNING GOALS:
    1. gain knowledge updating sequential files as related to data base systems.
    2. gain knowledge about programs and software systems involving trees, blocking/deblocking, sort/merge, updating sequential files, and b-trees.


II Student Outcomes (Sos) for the Computer Science Program:
    Students will be able to:
	1. apply structured principles and good practices to the task of developing software systems.
	4. communicate both technical and non-technical aspects of their work in formal and informal situations.
	5. apply formal methods to the process of constructing a system and an appreciation of the need to study and develop such methods.
	7. analyze various aspects of the process used when designing a system and employ established frameworks to evaluate the completed work.

TOPICS (not necessarily in order of coverage):
    * Sequential file processing
    * Indexed Files
    * Hashed Files
    * Tree Structured Files
    * Secondary storage media
    * Introduction to database
    * Software Design Processes and Principles
    * Software Development Processes and Principles
    * and more...
    * (I will expect students to learn the complexities {bigO} of the
        operations on the data structures we discuss and to be able
        to select, based on those complexities, the most appropriate ADT
        considering the nature of the data and how it will be accessed.)

PREREQUISITES:
    [Prereq.: CSCI 591 or equivalent (A course in data structures using C++)]
    We also assume that you have an operational facility with Unix, hardware, and OS theory.
    We do not have time for an extensive recapitulation of topics covered in the prerequisite courses.



ACADEMIC HONESTY:
    You are expected to do your own homework.  If you copy someone else's
    work or allow someone else to copy your work, you are being academically
    dishonest and will be subject to severe disciplinary action which may
    include any or all of: no credit for the work in question, a failing grade
    for the course, notification to the university that you have violated your
    Code of Conduct.  Use of recording devices during exams is prohibited.
    If you must quote or paraphrase another source, citation is essential,
    otherwise plagiarism has been committed.  You are expected to be familiar
    with your rights and obligations as outlined in the &quot;Code of Conduct&quot;
    [<A HREF="http://www.stcloudstate.edu/studenthandbook/documents/2013_14_codeofconduct.pdf">http://www.stcloudstate.edu/studenthandbook/documents/2013_14_codeofconduct.pdf</A>]  See also:

STUDYING IN GROUPS:
    I encourage you to study with someone else in the class, but when you
    prepare the final documents to turn in be sure that it is your own words
    and sentences and that you understand it.  If you represent someone
    else’s work as your own or allow someone else to turn your work in as
    theirs you will be turned in for cheating and will be given an F.

DECORUM: Conduct yourself so as not to distract others. In particular
    * Silence all cell phones, watch alarms, and similar devices.
    * Do not engage in distracting activities like reading a newspaper
      or sleeping. [ the snoring can be so distracting... :^) ]
    * Arrive for class on time, and be ready to begin.
      If you must be late, be quiet.
    * If you are early, sit toward the middle of a row.
    * Do not start packing up before class ends.

ATTENDANCE:
    You are responsible for knowing what happens at each class meeting.

QUIZZES:
    There will be a sequence of quizzes of assigned readings.

EXAMS:
    There will be a small set of intermediate exams and a comprehensive
    final exam.
    Exams will be based on the notes; that is, on the presentations in class,
    as well as on the assigned readings and assignments.
    Calculators will be neither necessary nor allowed.
    Make-up exams will be given in only in extreme (or university sanctioned) circumstances and only with prior notice.

GRADING:
        Your grade will be determined by the contributions of your scores
        on assignments,  quizzes, intermediate and final exams.
        Makeup of tests, quizzes, and exams are by prior arrangement only.

APPROXIMATE POINTS:
        Term Paper              35%
        Quizzes                 05%
        Hour Exams              30%
        Final Exam              30%

FINAL EXAM: Monday, December 11, 9:55 - 12:10 in EB A122.

CAVEAT:
    I reserve the right to amend the contents of this syllabus with
    notification.
