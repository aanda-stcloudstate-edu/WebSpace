<h4>
Development</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Use <i>lots</i> of white space and consistent structural indentation to
maximise the readability of your program.&nbsp; The easier it is to read,
the easier it is to debug;</li>

<li>
Consider starting with the psuedocode version of your program as a basis
for the descriptive comments in your program.&nbsp; Insert code below the
comments which describe it;</li>

<li>
Solve the <i>smallest </i>possible version of the problem you're attacking.&nbsp;
Once that is correct, scale up;</li>

<li>
Procede incrementally.&nbsp; Ensure you're program is correct in stages:</li>

<ul>
<li>
code</li>

<li>
compile</li>

<li>
test</li>

<li>
repeat</li>
</ul>

<li>
Test with the most diverse possible set of test data at each stage;</li>

<li>
Use an editor with syntax highlighting such as vim or emacs;</li>

<li>
Follow the suggestions in&nbsp; the <u>SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROGRAMMING
STYLE</u> section of each of the chapters we have or are covering;</li>

<li>
Follow the suggestions and directives in Appendix H, <u>Program Standards
and Styles</u>;</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Syntax errors</h4>

<ul>
<li>
If the compiler generates a list of error messages, look for a problem
at location of the earliest line number mentioned, <i>and the lines preceding&nbsp;
it</i>.</li>

<ul>
<li>
After you think you've corrected it, <u>recompile</u>.&nbsp; Often, many
of the subsequent error messages were propogated from the one you corrected
and will disappear.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Make sure:</li>

<ul>
<li>
you have followed all directives in the <u>TIPS AND COMMON PROGRAMMING
ERRORS</u> section of each of the chapters we have or are covering;</li>

<li>
all variable are declared, and also initialized when necessary;</li>

<li>
all statements end with a semicolon;</li>

<li>
all delimiters (e.g. parentheses, apostrophes, quotes, brackets, and braces)
are matched;</li>

<ul>
<li>
To this end, I recommend always starting a delimiter bracketed expression
with the matched delimiters and then inserting into them.&nbsp; (e.g.,
begin writing&nbsp; a string literal with "", and then insert into the
pair)</li>
</ul>

<li>
all necessary libraries have been properly included;</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h4>
Logic errors</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Trace by hand: try to recreate by hand what you expect each successive
statement will do.</li>

<li>
Program tracing: print out the values of variables at intermediate stages
to track how they are changing.&nbsp; Are the changes what you expected?</li>
</ul>
